Even more, studies continue to make additional exposures on male infertility.\n\nAn estimated 15 per cent of couples meet this criterion and they are considered to be infertile, with approximately 35 per cent of the cases due to female factors alone, 30 per cent due to male factors alone and 20 per cent due to a combination of female and male factors.\n\nWhile 15 per cent of the cases are regarded as unexplained infertility, the conditions of the male that affect fertility, also responsible for a whopping 30 per cent of infertility cases, are still generally under-diagnosed and undertreated.\n\nA man\'s fertility generally relies on the quantity and quality of his sperm. If the number of sperm a man ejaculates is low or if the sperm is of poor quality, it will be difficult and sometimes impossible for him to achieve pregnancy.\n\nMale infertility is usually caused by problems that affect either sperm production in the testes or sperm transport.

Abdelaziz says Nurmagomedov will continue to train, however, and has said he would like to fight in September, December and next April.\n\n\"He gave me very specific instructions,\" Abdelaziz told ESPN. \"He said he wants to fight Sept. 7, and again in December. And if [former welterweight champion] Georges St-Pierre can figure things out with the UFC by April, that\'s the deal. He would like that fight in April.\"\n\nSt-Pierre, 37, announced his retirement from mixed martial arts last December. During that announcement, he admitted he would love to fight Nurmagomedov, but claimed the UFC wished to go in another direction. Nurmagomedov considers St-Pierre a legend and has always wanted to face him.\n\nRegardless of any development with St-Pierre, however, it is clear Nurmagomedov wants to be active. He is currently serving a nine-month suspension from the Nevada State Athletic Commission for his role in a post-fight melee at UFC 229 last October. He is expected to return against interim champion Dustin Poirier at UFC 242 on Sept. 7 in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"The lightweight division has a lot of contenders and we need to keep the division going,\" Abdelaziz said. \"Khabib has done this before. He fought [Edson Barboza], Al [Iaquinta] and Conor [McGregor] in less than one year [from December 2017 to October 2018]. If it can be Georges in April, he would love that fight. If not, it can be any contender.\"\n\nWhen asked if Nurmagomedov, of Dagestan, has any interest in a rematch against McGregor, after the two continued to go back and forth on social media as recent as last month, Abdelaziz said it depends on whether McGregor reasserts himself as a No. 1 contender.\n\n\"To be honest, Conor is going to have to go out there and fight somebody like Justin Gaethje, Tony Ferguson or Cowboy [Donald Cerrone],\" Abdelaziz said. \"He\'s not a worthy enough opponent right now. That\'s the feeling from all of us, as a team.\"\n\nOf course, Nurmagomedov\'s plan involves defeating Poirier at UFC 242 first -- and that has his full attention, according to Abdelaziz.\n\nIt will mark a special event for Nurmagomedov, as it will take place in the United Arab Emirates, a very strong Muslim region, and his father is expected to corner him. Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov has not been able to corner Nurmagomedov in fights in the U.S. due to visa issues.\n\n\"Mixed martial arts in the Middle East and North Africa became so big after Khabib won his fight against Conor because Khabib was honoring these people,\" Abdelaziz said. \"To go to Abu Dhabi and put on a show for these people, to show these young, Muslim kids there is something called the UFC and you can become a UFC champion, doesn\'t matter what race or religion you come from, it\'s very special for Khabib.

With Palestinian militants threatening to send rockets deeper into Israel and Israeli reinforcements massing near the Gaza frontier, the fighting showed no signs of slowing down.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spent most of the day huddled with his Security Cabinet.\n\nLate on Sunday, the Cabinet instructed the army to \"continue its attacks and to stand by\" for further orders.\n\nIsrael also claimed to have killed a Hamas commander involved in transferring Iranian funds to the group.\n\nIsrael and Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks Israel\'s destruction, have fought three wars since Hamas violently seized control of Gaza from Western-backed Palestinian forces in 2007. They have fought numerous smaller battles, most recently two rounds in March.\n\nWhile lulls in fighting used to last for months or even years, these flare-ups have grown increasingly frequent as a desperate Hamas, weakened by a crippling Egyptian-Israeli blockade imposed 12 years ago, seeks to put pressure on Israel to ease the closure.\n\nThe blockade has ravaged Gaza\'s economy, and a year of Hamas-led protests along the Israeli frontier has yielded no tangible benefits. In March, Hamas faced several days of street protests over the dire conditions.\n\nWith little to lose, Hamas appears to be trying to step up pressure on Mr Netanyahu at a time when the Israeli leader is vulnerable on several fronts.\n\nFresh off an election victory, Mr Netanyahu is now engaged in negotiations with his hard-line political partners on forming a governing coalition.\n\nIf fighting drags on, the normally cautious leader could be weakened in his negotiations as his partners push for a tougher response.\n\nLater this week, Israel marks Memorial Day, one of the most solemn days of the year, and its festive Independence Day.\n\nNext week, Israel is to host the Eurovision song contest. Prolonged fighting could overshadow these important occasions and deter foreign tourists.\n\nThe arrival of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins Monday, does not seem to be deterring Hamas.\n\nBut the group is also taking a big risk if it pushes too hard. During the 50-day war in 2014, Israel killed over 2,200 Palestinians, over half of them civilians, according to UN tallies, and caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure.\n\nWhile Hamas is eager to enhance its credentials as a resistance group, the Gazan public has little stomach for another devastating war.\n\n\"Hamas is the change seeker,\" said retired Brig Gen.

Twenty-three Palestinians died. The exchange threatened to push the sides toward a new war and derail efforts to broker a longer-term truce. Mediation over a new ceasefire was underway Sunday night.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spent much of the day locked in a 41/2-hour emergency meeting with his security cabinet. He said he had instructed the military to continue strikes and prepare \"for the next stages.\"\n\nEarlier Sunday, Netanyahu said he had ordered \"massive attacks against terrorist elements in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nEli Cohen, minister for the economy and a security cabinet member, said the meeting ended with a \"clear decision.\"\n\n\"We are preparing for a campaign against Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and we will extract a price from them they have not experienced yet,\" he said.\n\nIsrael generally holds Hamas, which controls Gaza, responsible for any rocket fire from the area. But the Israeli military said Islamic Jihad, the second largest militant faction in Gaza, had instigated the violence.\n\nIsrael\'s Iron Dome missile defense system appeared to be overwhelmed by the barrage, intercepting only 150 of the 510 rockets that crossed into Israeli territory. The Israeli military said about 90 rockets fell short.\n\nIsrael said it responded with airstrikes against more than 320 military targets in Gaza. Palestinian militant factions said they were retaliating in an \"unprecedented manner\" after residential buildings were hit, and threatened to expand the range of their rockets if the \"aggression\" continued.\n\nPalestinian health officials said the dead in Gaza included two pregnant women, a 12-year-old boy and two infants. The Israeli military denied it was responsible for the strike that killed one of the pregnant women and a baby, saying a Palestinian rocket misfired.\n\nIt was the deadliest round of fighting since the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, and the Israeli civilian casualties were the first from rocket fire since then. The exchange came amid negotiations between Israel and Hamas over a deal in which Israel would ease restrictions on Gaza in return for calm.\n\nHamas accuses Israel of reneging on its commitments so far, including a deal it said they agreed to after the last violent flare-up in March. which caused Netanyahu to cut short a visit to Washington. Hamas said Israel had agreed to continue to permit $30 million in Qatari cash for employment projects and humanitarian aid, expand fishing rights and ease trade restrictions.\n\nIn recent months, the cash has not arrived, Hamas has fallen under increasing pressure ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a time of traditional fasting and feasting.\n\n\"Hamas believes that Netanyahu has abandoned his commitments, and they believe this is a very important time to put on pressure and get Israel to make good on promises,\" said Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of politics at Gaza\'s al-Azhar University.\n\nHe pointed to Israel\'s independence day celebrations this week and the Eurovision song contest the week after. The popular international singing competition is to be broadcast from Tel Aviv, with Madonna expected to perform.\n\n\"Whether the calculation was right or wrong, we\'ll see,\" Abusada said.\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said a \"return to calm\" was possible if Israel committed to implementing the \"understandings\" that had been reached.\n\nReports in Palestinian media that a ceasefire had been reached for midnight could not be confirmed.\n\n\"The ceasefire is possible, but the occupation has to pay for its obligations,\" Islamic Jihad leader Daoud Shihab said.\n\nWhile Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they hoped to strong-arm Israel into easing restrictions on Gaza, Israel announced it would cease all fuel imports into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, impacting Gaza\'s already patchy power supply.\n\nSchools across southern Israel shut down on Sunday as rockets rained down, and streets on both sides of the border were virtually deserted. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said Israel\'s Iron Dome system was dealing with a \"diverse\" and \"fast-paced\" threat.\n\nAmos Yadlin, former head of Israeli military intelligence, said Hamas had probably developed a new tactic to bypass the Iron Dome.\n\n\"They are using the same kind of rockets they used in the past,\" said Yadlin, now head of Israel\'s Institute for National Security Studies. \"But this time, they are firing them in a salvo of eight, 10 or 12 at the same time.\"\n\nConricus said 35 rockets had struck urban areas. The first Israeli civilian fatality from rocket fire since 2014 came in the early hours Sunday, when a 58-year-old man was killed after a rocket hit his home in Ashkelon.\n\nA 50-year-old Israeli man was killed in a factory in Ashkelon, and a 67-year-old Israeli man succumbed to his injuries after an antitank missile hit his car. As night fell, a fourth Israeli, in his early 20s, according to Israeli media, was confirmed killed in the southern city of Ashdod.\n\nIn Gaza, Israeli strikes toppled buildings as high as seven stories. Palestinian officials there said one strike Sunday evening hit an apartment, killing a 31-year-old man, a 30-year-old woman and a 4-month-old girl.\n\nConricus said Israeli intelligence had confirmed that a Palestinian woman and a 14-month-old baby killed the day before did not die as a result of an Israeli strike, but of Palestinian rocket fire.\n\nIslamic Jihad said seven of those killed were its militants. Hamas did not confirm fatalities among its fighters.\n\nConricus said Israeli targets included weapons storage facilities in the homes of militants, attack tunnels and military headquarters. The Turkish news agency Anadolu said its Gaza office was struck.\n\nThe Israeli military said an armored brigade and two infantry brigades had mobilized to the border area and were prepared for \"offensive\" action. Officials also said they had carried out the first targeted assassination of a Hamas militant in \"several years.\"\n\nConricus said the military worked with the Israeli Security Agency to assassinate Hamed Khudary, 34, who it said was responsible for channeling Iranian money to Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\n\nRight-wing Israeli politicians have repeatedly called on Netanyahu to restart the tactic of targeted assassinations.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hoped the sides would return to the cease-fire that had been in place for weeks and had been \"holding significantly.\"\n\n\"It\'s pretty serious,\" he told Fox News on Sunday. \"The Israelis have every right to defend themselves.\"\n\nIsrael previously denied it had reached a cease-fire deal with Hamas. Representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad were locked in negotiations in Cairo on Sunday as Egypt attempted to broker a truce.\n\nShimrit Meir, an Israeli analyst, linked the escalation to Hamas\'s discontent over the delivery of Qatari assistance.\n\n\"It\'s nearly Ramadan; people are starving,\" she said. \"We as Israelis think about the Eurovision, but they are preoccupied with demands from the public. They are waiting for the Qatari cash.\"\n\nBasim Naim, a senior Hamas official, said there were several reasons for the escalation, one of which was the lack of progress in negotiations on a long-term deal with Israel.\n\n\"We\'ve talked about long- and short-term solutions, money, the fishing zone, but nothing is happening on the ground,\" he said.\n\nHe said Hamas had tried to rein in violence at border protests on Friday but was frustrated by Israel\'s continued use of live fire against the demonstrators.

(305, '2019-05-05 23:03:58', 'nytimes.com', 'Ramadan', 'While Enes Kanter is Observing Ramadan, the World Will Be Watching Him', 'On Monday, around 4 a.m., Enes Kanter will wake up, eat a light breakfast of yogurt, fruit and peanut butter, and drink as much water as he can. Then for the roughly 16 hours between sunrise and sunset in Portland, Ore., the center for the Portland Trail Blazers will abstain from eating, drinking and taking medicine, even for the shoulder he separated almost two weeks ago. For Kanter, a Swiss-born Turk who has fasted for Ramadan while playing competitive basketball for the past decade, the routine is nothing new. But this time, the circumstances may be: Never before has he fasted while playing in the N.B.A.\'s postseason.\n\nThis year, with Ramadan beginning on Sunday, his fast will come during Portland\'s second-round series against the Denver Nuggets. He\'s averaging nearly 20 points and more than 10 rebounds per game against Denver, and has been a surprise difference-maker for the Blazers behind Damian Lillard.\n\nIn Islam, Ramadan commemorates the month that God started to reveal the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad, and each year roughly 1.5 billion people observe it through daytime fasting, during which smoking, sex and chewing gum are also prohibited. In Muslim-majority countries like Turkey, where Kanter grew up, businesses and schools often adjust their hours to accommodate the observance. In the United States, it\'s business as usual for most of the estimated 3.45 million Muslims, including Kanter. He\'s become accustomed to fasting by himself.\n\nThe first time Kanter observed Ramadan while training seriously for basketball, he was 16 years old, living in Turkey and playing for a team with an international roster. That year, Ramadan started at the end of August -- each year, it moves back by about 11 days -- and the first two-a-day practice was grueling for Kanter.\n\n\"I was going against players who were 30, 35 years old, and I was the only one fasting,\" he said. \"When I would break my fast, I was drinking so much water, like \'Man, there\'s no room left for food.\'\"\n\nSince then, Kanter has spent Ramadan in California, where he attended prep school; in Lexington, where he was recruited to play for the University of Kentucky; and with three N.B.A. franchises before the Trail Blazers: the Utah Jazz, the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Knicks. Though there have been other Muslims in the league (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar converted to Islam in 1968, a year before he began a 20-season N.B.A. career, and Hakeem Olajuwon was known for playing well while fasting), Kanter still makes a point of telling teams about the duties of his faith.\n\n\"Before I go to those teams, I say, \'Hey, I\'m a Muslim and I have to pray five times a day,\'\" Kanter said. \"And they respect it so much that they give me a prayer room. So before the game, after the game, before practice, before I fly out, I can go to that room whenever I want and pray.\"\n\nAfter he joins a new franchise, Kanter said, there are always questions at first, like why he doesn\'t drink alcohol, but they\'re typically asked with good intentions. In fact, an Oklahoma City strength coach was so curious about Ramadan that he fasted for three days to better understand Kanter\'s nutritional needs. The teams also provide special meals for Kanter, which some of his teammates have grown to love.\n\n\"Steven Adams was a very, very big fan of halal food,\" Kanter said of the Thunder center, \"and I remember the day I got traded to the Knicks, he was so sad. He was like, \'Man, I\'m not going to eat halal food anymore.\'\"\n\nThough the past few Ramadans have been during his off-season, Kanter enjoys the feeling of fasting so much that he does it once or twice a week year-round. That routine has helped reassure him that his cravings, typically at their worst 15 minutes after basketball practice, will eventually pass.\n\nEven traveling from the East Coast to the West, which adds three hours to the fast, no longer rattles him. \"If you can do 15,\" he said, \"you can do 18.\"\n\nFasting doesn\'t necessarily pose a nutritional problem for Kanter, said Dr. Richard Bloomer, dean of the School of Health Studies and the Center for Wellness and Fitness at the University of Memphis.\n\n\"A lot of people think, \'Gee, my carbohydrate or glycogen stores could be depleted,\'\" he said. \"That would be problematic, but the reality is, if they\'re eating adequately during the \'acceptable\' feeding period, they should be able to store all of the energy that they need.\"\n\nRecent studies have shown that fasting can both help and hurt an athlete\'s anaerobic performance; Dr. Bloomer said that players\' experiences also depended on their mind-sets. If Kanter believes that fasting inhibits his play, it may, \"even though there may not be physiological adverse outcomes,\" Dr. Bloomer said.\n\nFor Kanter, though, that\'s not a problem. \"I actually work harder during Ramadan because my body\'s used to it,\" he said.\n\nTareq Azim, a San Francisco-based N.F.L. trainer who was a linebacker at Fresno State, felt the same. \"The level of clarity during Ramadan was just always insane -- the way I can think and take in information,\" Azim said. \"Technically, I\'d become really sound during that month. I wouldn\'t rely so much on strength and power.\"\n\nAzim remembered a particular game against Colorado State, when he was on the field well after the sun had set. During a break, a concerned teammate rushed out and squirted water into his mouth.\n\n\"He was like, \'You got to break the fast, man. You got to get something in you,\'\" Azim said. \"I felt so light, like I was floating. And I always see that reference point when I feel like breaking during Ramadan. It\'s almost like you generate a second wind.\"\n\nLike Kanter, Azim has learned to cope with the challenges of fasting during Ramadan as he\'s gotten older. In the fifth grade, when he started attempting to fast for Ramadan, he\'d wake up with his parents around 4 a.m. to eat suhur, the meal right before sunrise.\n\n\"It\'d be so difficult to try and stay up and eat,\" he said. \"I\'d sit up and maybe put a bite of an egg in my mouth and literally fall right over.\"\n\nAfter a few more hours of sleep, Azim would fast for as long as he could, but with nothing in his stomach, it wasn\'t easy. \"Sometimes I would last until 10 a.m.,\" he said.\n\nAs Kanter prepares for Game 5 of Portland\'s second-round series against the Nuggets, he, too, will be wary of missing that last meal before sunrise and having to fast an extra 15 hours. He has a plan.\n\n\"That\'s why I always put my phone away from my bed,\" he said, \"to make sure that I don\'t fall back asleep and skip suhur.\"', '1128839589', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/06/sports/06Kanter-illo/06Kanter-illo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'The New York Times', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1128839589.php', 'On Monday, around 4 a.m., Enes Kanter will wake up, eat a light breakfast of yogurt, fruit and peanut butter, and drink as much water as he can.

This is by design. The timing is too perfect.\n\nIn the coming weeks, White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner and his team will be presenting their Middle East peace plan. The unveiling could be just over a month away following the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on June 4. By that time, it\'s likely Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be forming a coalition government.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been in a growing state of chaos for months as its people have been taking to the streets to protest living conditions in the area. They are sanctioned or blocked by multiple governments and organizations, making it difficult to get the necessary resources. But even if they received them, it\'s unlikely they would go where they\'re needed. Many have viewed past aggressions as attempts to garner sympathy and force international aid to be pushed through.\n\nBut the ongoing attacks today, which now include over 700 rockets and mortars fired into Israel, are a completely different degree of escalation. Both sides are talking about all-out war, and while neither Hamas nor Iran-backed Islamic Jihad is impotent, they are in no position to wage war against Israel without causing extreme harm to their tiny region.\n\nThat\'s the point. They want to be harmed. Or, to be more specific, they leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad want the people living in their territory to be harmed by Israel to expand the already-unfathomable level of hatred towards the Jewish state from the international community.\n\nThis is why they commit, as Netahyahu calls it, \"double war crime\" by indiscriminately shooting at civilians from civilian centers. They are like comic book villains who hide behind the innocent while attacking other innocents, daring the good guys to try to hit them without harming the innocents. It\'s sickening.\n\nBut this isn\'t just about Israel. The Palestinian Authority is also an indirect target of the Hamas/PIJ. The hope is to center negotiations on the Gaza Strip first and foremost, giving them the leverage for additional influence over East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The PA wants to unify a Palestinian state under their authority, but Hamas has eyes on reversing that notion. This is why the timing of their attacks is significant. They want a bigger seat at the table and they\'re willing to use rockets to force the issue.\n\nI might actually work.\n\nMeanwhile PA leader Mahmoud Abbas is stuck trying to retain control and relevance. He may not be able to retain either.\n\nWhen things don\'t seem to make sense, such as the incessant attacks on Israel by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, don\'t assume it\'s random.

This is the highest percentage ever, in a longterm upward trend in confidence.\n\nGruesome earlier events provide important backdrop.\n\nIn May 2018, the Islamic State conducted bloody terrorist attacks in Surabaya, Indonesia\'s second largest city.\n\nTerrorism is persistent though not frequent in Indonesia. In a 2016 attack, four people died. In 2002, the worst attack killed 202 people on Bali, including many foreign tourists. These crimes have only has strengthened Indonesian hostility to terrorism. Terrorist bombings in Sri Lanka over Easter weekend further reinforce such sentiments.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia parliamentary elections in May 2018 resulted in a stunning upset. The governing party was defeated and an opposition coalition successful. The Barisan Nasional and predecessor party had governed Malaysia from independence.\n\nNew prime minister Mahathir Mohamad at 92 is the oldest head of government in the world. Mohamad secured a pardon for jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nIndonesia\'s election took place in the world\'s largest nation with a Muslim majority. Geography including trade routes provides Indonesia and Malaysia with great strategic significance. The international and foreign policy implications are self-evident, for the United States and other nations.\n\nWashington now has an opportunity to highlight Indonesia, and neighbouring nations, as success stories of expanding political stability, modernisation and the rule of law. In 1998, opponents forced Indonesia\'s long-time autocratic president and former general Muhammad Suharto from power. Since then, the nation has had representative government.\n\nIndonesia\'s international conflicts today are largely technical and legal, notably the maritime disputes which generally involve the nations of East and Southeast Asia. Dictatorship has ended, but corruption remains a problem.\n\n=The situation used to be quite different.\n\nDuring the height of the Cold War, Indonesia was regarded as a pivotal leader among Third World nations. Flamboyant nationalist President Sukarno played the Soviet Union and US off against one another. CIA efforts to bring Sukarno down were frustrated, a sobering experience quickly overshadowed by Vietnam.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, cooperation between Indonesia and the Soviet Union was moving forward. This development was extremely important in the decision for large-scale US military intervention in Vietnam in 1965. Today, we largely have forgotten this history. British forces, with Australian and New Zealand allies, defeated Indonesia attacks on Malaysia. Earlier, Britain defeated a virulent, aggressive Communist insurgency in Malaya, which today is part of Malaysia.\n\nAmong other factors, Britain\'s military avoided introduction of massive firepower, in contrast to the US military strategy in Vietnam especially from 1965. To be sure, the British military employed air strikes and artillery, but relatively selectively. Officials rightly regarded heavy bombing as counterproductive. In the same category was the American emphasis on \"free-fire ones\" relatively early in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe US government has opportunities to strengthen ties with Indonesia, and through disciplined diplomacy throughout the enormous South and Southeast Asia regions.\n\nll we need is the will, the skill and the maturity.', '1126854985', 'null', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'intellasia.net', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1126854985.php', 'Indonesia has carried out democratic elections enormous in scale and importance, including for Americans.

Election authorities have until May 22 to release official results.\n\n\"The interest of the country is first and foremost,\" Sandiaga said when asked if he would consider a Cabinet post if the count, as expected, confirms that Joko wins again and makes an offer.\n\n\"I want to contribute to the country. It\'s about how we can deliver the best impact,\" Sandiaga said in the interview, his first with international media since the vote.\n\n\"It doesn\'t have to really be in the government. It could be outside the government, but again, I don\'t want to speculate. We\'ll have these conversations after May 22.\"\n\nSandiaga, 49, is nearly two decades younger than Prabowo and has expressed a desire to remain in politics after amassing millions of dollars as a private equity investor. He denied any rift with Prabowo, who has made repeated allegations of electoral fraud that have spurred protests from his supporters.\n\nSandiaga\'s apparent willingness to work with Joko could dampen fears of a drawn-out legal fight over the election results that could hinder policy making as a second term begins.\n\nJoko is facing the challenge of spurring economic growth, keeping a lid on the costs of staples and creating jobs, especially for the country\'s millennials and growing middle class.\n\nWith the official result possibly still possibly weeks away, allegations from the Prabowo camp of mass fraud are continuing to overshadow the election. Claims of a conspiracy between the government and election authorities have prompted concerns about potential unrest, with the ructions also seen as risking Indonesia\'s ability to lure much-needed foreign investment.\n\nUnofficial quick counts from a dozen pollsters on the day of the vote gave the election to Joko, with the ongoing tally from Indonesia\'s election commission mirroring that and showing him with a gap of about 10 percentage points.\n\n\"Let\'s go to the real count and let\'s make sure the process is fair, transparent and accountable,\" Sandiaga said.\n\nJoko\'s Security Affairs minister Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, has rejected the allegations of voter fraud as unfounded. The former commander of the Indonesian military urged calm and asked the public to resist being \"incited to take action\".\n\nThe president, meanwhile, is getting on the business of government, and jockeying has already begun for positions in his next Cabinet.\n\nLast Thursday, chair of the National Mandate Party (PAN) Zulkifli Hasan held talks with Joko in a meeting that has raised speculation of the party regaining a position in the Cabinet. The party had been a member of the Jokowi first-term coalition and held a Cabinet post until August when it joined forces with Prabowo ahead of the election campaign.\n\nSeveral PAN officials echoed Sandiaga in dismissing suggestions of a split between Prabowo\'s Gerindra party and PAN.\n\n\"PAN is still firmly in coalition with Gerindra,\" said Dradjad Wibowo, a senior member of PAN. \"Our focus is still on vote counting. We found a large number of cases of vote rigging and abuse of power by many state apparatus.\"\n\nA successful investor who drained a sizeable chunk of his private equity fortunehe said in a previous interview he had spent close to $100 million (S$136 million)during the election campaign, Sandiaga is now weighing his next move.\n\n\"We have been able to energise the base,\" he said, and it \"shows that people are really asking for change\".\n\nHe insisted he is staying in politics. Still, while regarded as potential future leader, he also risks seeing his presidential ambitions fade if he is left without a political platform.\n\nSandiaga made his fortune with PT Saratoga Investama Sedaya Tbk, an investment holding company he co-founded almost 20 years ago in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.\n\nThe graduate of George Washington University in the United States said ahead of the vote that he had lost close to a third of his net worth, which until recently had been in the vicinity of $360 million.\n\n\"I\'m not going back to business, he said. \"This is it.\"', '1124358125', 'null', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'intellasia.net', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1124358125.php', 'One of Joko Widodo\'s top political opponents said he is open to working with the Indonesian president following a disputed election this month, raisin....', 0, '', ''),

Australia\'s opposition party officially launched its election campaign putting health care and climate change at the forefront of its bid for election on May 18. AAP Image via AP Darren England\n\nAustralia\'s opposition party officially launched its election campaign on Sunday, putting health care and climate change at the forefront of its bid for election within two weeks.\n\nCenter-left Labor Party leader Bill Shorten promised to spend billions of dollars providing free dental care for pensioners, reducing waiting times at hospital emergency departments and eliminating costs for cancer patients.\n\n\"Cancer makes you sick. But in a rich country like ours, it shouldn\'t make you poor,\" Shorten told supporters at a convention center in Brisbane city.\n\nShorten also highlighted Labor\'s pledge to reduce Australia\'s greenhouse gas emissions by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. The conservative coalition government has committed to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% in the same time frame and warns that Labor\'s more ambitious target would wreck the economy.\n\nShorten said half the Liberal Party-led coalition \"simply don\'t believe climate change is real and the other half just don\'t care.\"\n\nCurbing greenhouse gases is a divisive issue in a country that is the world\'s biggest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was overthrown by hard right wingers in his own party in August in part because of his energy policy that would have increased electricity prices to reduce emissions.\n\nTurnbull was replaced as prime minister by Scott Morrison, who has attacked Shorten\'s lack of detail on how much Labor\'s emissions reduction target would cost the economy. Shorten argues that failure to act on climate change also carries an economic cost.\n\n\"He doesn\'t know the price of anything because he\'s not the one who is going to have to pay for it,\" Morrison told a Liberal Party rally on Sunday. \"You\'re the ones who are going to have to pay for it right across Australia.\"\n\nMorrison said his government would reduce taxes for all if it is elected on May 18 for a third three-year term.\n\nMost opinion polls since the 2016 election have put Labor ahead of the government.\n\nLabor\'s emphasis on health plays on one of its strengths. A Labor government in 1984 introduced Australia\'s popular publicly funded universal health care system known as Medicare.\n\nThe government accuses Labor of lying to voters in text messages days before the 2016 election that the conservatives planned to dismantle Medicare. The government blamed Labor\'s so-called \"Medi-scare campaign\" for the loss of 14 seats at the 2016 election, leaving the ruling coalition with a single-seat majority in the House of Representatives of 76.\n\nThe government now has only 74 seats after Turnbull quit Parliament and one of his supporters became an independent lawmaker. Labor holds 69 seats. The size of the House of Representatives, where parties need a majority to form a government, will expand from 150 to 151 seats at the election.\n\nPolitical parties officially launch their campaigns close to the election date when voters are starting to focus on competing policies. Morrison will launch the Liberal Party campaign next Sunday.\n\nLabor\'s launch was held in Queensland state where Australia\'s oldest political party was formed by striking sheep shearers under a tree in the town of Barcaldine in 1891. Queensland is also a state where five electorates were won in 2016 by margins of less the 1% of the votes, including a Labor seat won by 37 votes.\n\nThree former Labor prime ministers, Paul Keating, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard -- the nation\'s only woman prime minister -- were on hand to cheer Shorten on Sunday.\n\nKeating led his government to one of the worst defeats in the 118-year history of the Australian federation in 1996. Shorten as a party powerbroker played a key role in Labor dumping Prime Minister Rudd in 2010 and Gillard in 2013, only to be return Rudd to the helm.\n\nThe only other surviving Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke, sent his apologies.

He commands the New York political stage like the great names of the past: FDR, Nelson Rockefeller and, er, Donald Trump come to mind.\n\nIt\'s meant as a compliment. Politics is a good thing. A functioning democracy requires skilled politicians able to gauge public opinion, outmaneuver their adversaries, and wield power. Cuomo does all three well, as did the three aforementioned New Yorkers.\n\nThat certainly leaves him subject to criticism of his policies, for fiercely subjugating the slightest opposition and for undermining the checks and balances that protect us. But those objections are for another time. For now, stand back and admire.\n\nHe just blew through another budget, getting his way on just about everything and eliminating the two houses of the Legislature as functional checks on his power.\n\nBut his presidential foray is a case study for how to maximize a political opportunity that is otherwise thin soup. Cuomo has seized the limelight and made the argument for Joe Biden\'s presidential bid, just before the official announcement was made. Bold and persuasive, he is the public face of the Biden candidacy.\n\nWhat of Cuomo\'s own ambitions? There\'s a consensus among friends and foes that he wants to be president. There is also a sweeping psychological novel to be written on this subject. The strange case of his father\'s puzzling presidential noodling; the palpable contempt for many of the other contenders; his fierce criticism of the new progressive economic agenda; the careful advance of the progressive social agenda.\n\nAll of those things ripened as 2020 approached. But he was blocked. No pathway to the nomination was to be found. A minor concern was the candidacy of New York\'s junior senator, Kristen Gillibrand. A slightly larger concern was Cuomo\'s unpopularity with New York\'s political class. The sharp elbows that characterize everything he does are resented, and a political problem.\n\nBut the big roadblock is Biden himself. A Cuomo candidacy would wither away if Biden got his act together. Much to his credit, Cuomo figured this out.\n\nInstead of sulking, he embraced the reality. Andrew is for Joe.\n\nIf Biden prospers, Cuomo has made an obligated friend. Who knows what opportunities could be bestowed by President Biden? Who knows whether President Biden would seek re-election in 2024?\n\nIf Biden stumbles, who is better positioned to inherit the \"moderate,\" get-it-done, beat-Trump voter?\n\nWhen you write it down it seems obvious and easy. It\'s not. It requires setting aside ego and immediate gratification, having a plan, sticking to it, and executing it gracefully. This Cuomo has done, well and truly. He will need luck and a willingness to adjust tactics as events unfold. But he\'s in the game.\n\nFrom Aristotle, to Machiavelli, to Karl Rove and James Carville, we have an archive of political wisdom that insists on unblinking realism, cool calculation of probabilities and self-discipline as the pathway to power. When we get a glimpse of such in our hometown, it\'s worth noting.', '1128886882', 'https://s.hdnux.com/photos/75/67/66/16219553/99/rawImage.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Times Union', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1128886882.php', 'Give Gov.

Did it go too far? Peter Greste and Chris Masters have condemned the sting. One Nation\'s Queensland state leader Steve Dickson and chief of staff, James Ashby were filmed by Al Jazeera, a Middle Eastern media network, on a trip to the US seeking donations from the American gun lobby. Rodger Muller of Gun Rights Australia set up the introductions for One Nation. Asked how much money they were after, the One Nation pair suggested anywhere between $10 and $20 million.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald on March 27, 2019 also asks was it ethical? In creating the scenario in which the events were set up along the program\'s use of hidden cameras and microphones were the reasons why the newspaper questioned the ethics of Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Conversationalso asked whether Al Jazeera overstepped the mark. It concludes that \"The public has a clear right to know what One Nation is up to. \"This article goes further: that the Al Jazeera exposé was a necessary action, totally moral and decidedly in the public interest.\n\nPeter Greste said that journalists should never create the news, only report it. He is correct, of course, but only up to a point. If the One Nation executives had not made the statements \"If One Nation could get $10 million it could get 8 senators\" or that Muslims \"are breaking into people\'s homes with baseball bats\", there would be no news. One Nation made the news, not Al Jazeera.\n\nThis opinion piece is hesitant to disagree with such well-regarded journalists as Peter Greste and Chris Masters. But it argues that the sting was a positive ethical move, clearly in the public interest. It was similar to blowing the whistle on a wrong doing. Whistleblowers have been castigated for centuries, only recently achieving some sort of protection in Australia. But they are not regarded highly. Greste and Masters were undoubtedly confused in balancing the public interest against the criticisms levelled at people who expose wrongdoing. They are not unique. Whistleblowers have been attacked for centuries, including by moral philosophers\n\nOne book on Business Ethics, unfortunately taught on many ethics classes throughout Australia, labels whistleblowing as akin to the \" worst excesses of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia\":\n\nFirst, it is informing, perhaps on peers or mates. Informing was characteristic of the worst excesses of Nazi Germany or the Soviet system. It is sneaky, underhand and destroys trust in the workplace. Second, it involves disclosure of information that is owned by the organisation, not by individuals. It is theft to disclose the information without authorisation... the third objection: taking on the responsibility of looking after the public interest is arrogant and might destroy the organisation and jobs of colleagues... Fourth ...might not be in a good position to judge if the public interest will be served. Fifth the act breaks an employee\'s contract with an employer... Sixth, an employee has only a duty to report concerns to superiors, not rectify problems personally.\n\nThis view is perhaps excessively worded, but the denigration of whistleblowers is not uncommon. Terms such as \"snitching\", \"ratting\", \"informing\", \"turning in\", or, in Australia, \"dobbing\" have long been associated with the practice. This article disagrees strongly, putting forward the view that exposing wrongdoing by people who are aware of the wrong is one of the most powerful ways of bringing about a more ethical society.\n\nA definition of whistleblowing by two of the more highly regarded researchers on whistleblowing in the US, Janet Near & Marcia Miceli .\n\nAn action that brings harm or has the potential to bring harm, directly or indirectly, to the public at large, now or in the future, is an action against the public interest.\n\nWeakening Australia\'s gun laws will certainly bring harm to the country, and would be against the public interest.

It is absolutely impossible. You may be good. And you may even be better than everyone else, but without outside input, you will never become as good as you could be. Sweetheart, you will do better when someone is watching and evaluating. This is why you need a coach, a good coach.\n\nEvery top athlete and athletic team has a coach. In the world of athletics, nobody performs his way out of needing a coach. As it is in the world of athletics so it is in the world of leadership. You will never lead to a level where you\'d stop needing a coach. In fact, the longer you lead, the more important is your need of a coach. There are many people, who have been leading for many years -- who now think that they no longer need to be led. This is a very wide of the mark mindset.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is dangerous to follow anyone who is not being led by anyone. Does your leader have a leader? If he does not have, you are sitting on a time bomb that will explode real soon. There are too many \'self-made\' leaders today, who are not accountable to anyone in our nation and they do have millions of people following them. It is not ideal to follow a leader who is not following a leader.\n\nAnother Nigerian stabbed to death in South Africa\n\nFor the umpteenth time, without a coach, you cannot lead at your best. You may lead better than everyone around you, but you will not be able to lead as much as you can consequent on your potential. Not long ago, I did read through a beautiful story of a student who was very good at a subject. He knew he was so good at it, his lecturer did know and everyone in his department did know too! One day, his lecturer tested all of them in the department. After the test, he knew he would score more than others, because he knew he was better than them all. But when the results came out, everyone in the class scored higher than him! As an effect of this, he became so furious and swimming in the pool of anger, he went to his lecturer to find out what went wrong. This is what his coach said to him: \"I know you are better than them all, but you did not perform up to your potential...I did not grade you based on the performances of others, but I did grade you based on your own potential...\" This is what a good coach would do for you. A good coach will continue to stretch you, so you can keep beating your own record. Without a coach, you will be comparing yourself and performance with others, doing better than others, but performing bellow your potential. The truth is, if you do not have a coach, you are living far below your potential.\n\nIn the world of business and leadership, we do operate under the misguided assumption that because we are leaders, we do not need to be led. There will not be a day in our leadership when we would stop needing leaders to lead us. I do have leaders and I will continue to have leaders till I breathe my last on earth. Remember, the day you stop being led is the day you\'d stop leading at your best.\n\nAlso, to become the best there is in your field, you must enlist the relevant help of others. I have said this over and over that you can never become the best in your field while running alone. Every Andrew Agassi would need Gil Reyes to become the best in his field of sport. Mike Tyson also needed the help of his coach to become the best in the boxing ring. To become the best in your field of business, you will need to enlist the help of a good coach. This is non-negotiable!\n\nHussein Bolt\'s coach cannot run as fast as he does, but he coached him to be the fastest man on earth! Your coach does not need to be as good as you are in your field, but he or she must be good enough to know your strengths and be adept enough to help you harness them. Remember, you are not running against the strengths of your coach, you are only running against your own strengths!\n\nAs I begin to coast home today, I am sure you know that there are men and women in the marketplace whom we look up to with the false assumption that they \"make it\" on their own, that they are what they are because of talent and discipline alone, but as you probe deeper into their stories, however, you will find out that each one often has one or two key people who coached them to success. The question is: do you want to become successful in life? If yes, then you need to understand that you cannot become successful without being coached to success.\n\nIn the world of athletics, the coach does not withhold his opinion until asked. Neither does he sit back and watch his protégé make the same mistake over and over without saying something. In the same way, a good leadership coach will do everything in his power to ensure progress. Like an athletic coach, a leadership coach operates as if he has something on the line. A win for the man or woman he is coaching is a win for himself as well. Wins and losses are personal. Good leadership coaches function as if they have something at stake in your performance. Once again, you need a good coach, but beyond that, you also need to become a good coach to others!\n\nLastly, there is something in many of us that resists being coached in the realm of leadership. We are willing to spend outrageous amount of time and money perfecting out putts, serves and wings, but when it comes to our leadership, we resist input. Maybe it is the way leaders are wired. Maybe it is pride. And maybe it is because we are unteachable. Remember, any leader who refuses to submit himself to the counsel of others is too dangerous to follow.', '1128884440', 'https://www.tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Leaders-forum-new.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Tribune', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1128884440.php', 'You will never be able to maximize your potential in any area without coaching.

The flagship YTL Corp Bhd announced that its 98%-owned unit YTL Cement Bhd is spending RM1.63 billion to buy a 51% stake in Lafarge Malaysia Bhd from Associated International Cement Ltd, which is currently on a divestment spree in the region.\n\nThe acquisition is considered a big deal amid the dearth of major corporate exercises in the past two years.\n\nThe transaction price of RM3.75 per share is at a 25% premium to Lafarge Malaysia\'s net tangible assets of RM2.99 per share as at end-2018, while standing at 19% above Lafarge Malaysia\'s five-day volume weighted average share price of RM3.15 (last Thursday).\n\nThe acquisition is likely to cost YTL Cement even more, given that it is required to make a mandatory general offer (MGO) to minority shareholders. The MGO will cost it as much as RM1.56 billion should all minority shareholders accept the offer.\n\nTo recap, Lafarge Malaysia\'s share price already had rebounded from a 10-year low of RM1.80 in February to RM3.30 last Wednesday before the news. The stock soared to RM3.72 last Friday.\n\nLooking at the three-year share price trend which showed the stock seemingly falling like a rock from RM8 to below RM2 until early this year, the choice is rather obvious for Lafarge Malaysia shareholders, given the premium.\n\nNonetheless, it is exactly the hefty premium, which YTL Cement is willing to pay, that could prompt Lafarge Malaysia\'s minorities to have second thoughts of whether they should hold onto their shares.\n\nYTL group is known for its ability to hunt for good bargains at the right time. Why is the group, which has been in the cement industry for decades and knows that the industry is choked with overcapacity most of the time, willing to pay that high price for Lafarge Malaysia?\n\nOne reason is that YTL Cement has the financial muscle and the opportunity for it to be the leading player at present.\n\nThe deal was struck between YTL group and Lafarge\'s parent company LafargeHolcim Ltd.\n\n\"Now that opportunity for\n\nLafargeHolcim to exit Malaysia, YTL has the buying power to purchase the stake,\" said an analyst.\n\nAccording to an AllianceDBS note, YTL Cement and Lafarge Malaysia constitutes about 60% of the domestic cement market.\n\nSome analysts believe that YTL Cement\'s offer price of RM3.75 per share is a good deal for shareholders, as it constitutes a 25% premium to Lafarge Malaysia\'s net tangible assets of RM2.99 per share as at end-2018, while standing at 19% above Lafarge\'s five-day volume weighted average share price of RM3.15 (last Thursday).\n\nAffin Hwang Capital commented that the offer is deemed to be fair, as Lafarge Malaysia has been in the red since 2017, adding that the group has seen negative operating cash flows since then.\n\nIt wrote in a note last Friday that the proposed valuation is 1.25 times price to book value (P/BV) and is one standard deviation below Lafarge Malaysia\'s five-year mean.\n\nCGS-CIMB Research is also of the opinion that the offer is fair due to Lafarge Malaysia\'s loss-making state and a challenging domestic cement market characterised by oversupply, weak demand, competitive pricing and high operating costs.\n\n\"In our view, the deal provides an opportunity for minority shareholders to monetise their positions given that an immediate cement demand recovery beyond the revival of the East Coast Rail Link looks unlikely, as other mega projects remain under review,\" said CGS-CIMB Research.\n\nBoth CGS-CIMB Research and Affin Hwang Capital upgraded the stock to \"hold\" with a higher target price of RM3.75.\n\nFor the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18), Lafarge Malaysia\'s annual net loss widened to RM319.35 million, from the RM215.16 million net loss posted in FY17. Full-year revenue dropped to RM2.12 billion, from RM2.25 billion posted in FY17.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, consensus estimates forecast the group to make RM174 million loss in FY19 and RM21.1 million loss in FY20. This means Lafarge Malaysia is expected to see improving performance moving forward.\n\nIn contrast, AllianceDBS research advised minority shareholders in Lafarge Malaysia not to accept the offer while highlighting the acquisition would improve industry dynamics as a whole, which would result in better valuations for Lafarge Malaysia.\n\n\"We advise investors not to accept the offer. Assuming Lafarge remains listed, we believe the stock could fetch a higher valuation of RM4.55 -- assuming it is valued at 1.7 times book value, equivalent to its three-year P/BV forward mean,\" the research house said in a note last Friday.\n\nDespite YTL\'s intention to maintain the Lafarge Malaysia\'s listing status on Bursa Malaysia, the acquisition triggered an unconditional mandatory offer for the remaining 49% in Lafarge Malaysia.\n\nThis means that shareholders now have the opportunity to take up YTL\'s offer, and that if the conglomerate receives valid acceptances which result in its aggregated shareholdings of 90%, Lafarge Malaysia could be privatised.\n\nFurthermore, if at the end of the acquisition YTL Cement holds more than 75% or less than 90% of Lafarge Malaysia\'s shares, it would not comply with public spread requirements (which require more than 25% of a listed company\'s shareholdings to be made available to the public).\n\nLafarge\'s other substantial shareholders are Amanah Saham Bumiputra controlling 8.99% and FIL Ltd holding 6.41% or 54.47 million shares in the group. It would be interesting to see if the two intend to stay on.', '1128883893', 'https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/ytl-cement_20190506074920_theedgemarkets.jpg?null', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'The Edge Markets', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1128883893.php', 'KUALA LUMPUR: YTL group sprang a surprise last week and it seems to be a pleasant one.

Find out what\'s happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nNew York (CNN)On Monday, Michael Cohen will complete his transition from presidential fixer to prison inmate.\n\nCohen, the former personal attorney to President Donald Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and national deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, is set to report Monday to a federal prison in Otisville, New York, where he will begin serving a three-year sentence.It is likely to be an abrupt downgrade in lifestyle for an attorney accustomed to regular power breakfasts at the Upper East Side\'s Loews Regency hotel, with its $26 egg white frittatas, but Cohen has had some time to prepare.He was initially set to begin his sentence March 6, but his attorneys argued successfully for his prison date to be pushed back by two months. Cohen has used those months -- and the ones since he pleaded guilty in August 2018 to tax evasion, false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations tied to hush money payments he made or orchestrated on behalf of Trump -- to turn on his former boss.After admitting in federal court in Manhattan that \"in coordination and at the direction of\" Trump -- thinly disguised as \"Individual-1\" in court documents -- Cohen made or directed payments to silence women who claimed affairs with then-presidential candidate, Cohen pleaded guilty to an additional charge. This time, he admitted to having made false statements to Congress, lying about the duration of talks concerning a prospective Trump Tower in Moscow \"out of loyalty\" to Trump.Read MoreDuring those late 2018 months, he met multiple times with federal prosecutors from both the Manhattan US Attorney\'s office and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, as well as investigators from the New York attorney general\'s office and others.That December, Trump railed against his former attorney on Twitter, calling him a \"rat,\" and by early the following year, Cohen took his campaign against Trump to Capitol Hill.Cohen testified publicly before the House Oversight Committee in February, armed with evidence appearing to implicate the President: copies of checks signed by Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. that Cohen said were used to reimburse him for some of the hush money.He testified privately in three closed-door sessions with the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. And he appealed to Democrats on those committees to help him again postpone his prison date, telling them in April through his attorneys that he had more potential evidence to offer.But he didn\'t get a second delay. Cohen and his allies in recent days have argued he is somewhat of a scapegoat, saying he has taken the fall for the President and others over the payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, while never mentioning the five counts of tax evasion to which he pleaded.\"Cohen is still only Trump Co person going to jail. NOT Don Jr - who signed hush money checks. Why?\" Cohen adviser Lanny Davis said on Twitter on Friday. But while Cohen himself said at his sentencing that he felt it was his duty to cover up Trump\'s \"dirty deeds,\" he also took responsibility for the crimes.\"I want to be clear,\" he told the court. \"I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today, and it was my own weakness, and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light.\"', '1129170581', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190227171840-28-michael-cohen-house-hearing-0227-super-tease.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Michael Cohen to report to prison ', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1129170581.php', 'Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

(335, '2019-05-09 16:06:04', 'cnn.com', 'lifestyle', 'Anatomy of a smear: How far-right websites spread a fake story about Pete Buttigieg', '(CNN)This is a story about how political operatives tried to take down a presidential candidate, and ended up just humiliating themselves.\n\nIt\'s also a story about how a smear was spread by right-wing websites -- and was cleaned up by newsrooms that took some time to check the facts.On April 29 someone shared a post titled \"Pete Buttigieg Sexually Assaulted Me\" on Medium, a site that lets anyone upload stories, essays and any other bit of text. It was attributed to a college student named Hunter Kelly.Within hours, the fake allegation against the South Bend, Indiana mayor and Democratic presidential candidate would begin to crumble, and the real story -- the story of the smear campaign -- would emerge.But by then, the Medium post already had 12,000 Facebook interactions. It ricocheted around the right-wing internet, thanks to sites like Big League Politics, InfoWars, NewsWars and The Gateway Pundit, potentially reaching millions of readers, according to a media analysis from Ben Decker, CEO of the digital investigations firm Memetica.Read MoreAccording to Kelly, the scheme started when Jacob Wohl, a far-right internet personality, messaged Kelly on Instagram. \"Do you want to be part of a political operation?\" the message said, according to a copy reviewed by CNN.Kelly, a 21-year-old, gay, Donald Trump-supporter, was intrigued. On Sunday, the Michigan native took a late flight to the Washington area booked for him by Wohl and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and a conspiracy theorist.When Kelly arrived, he was taken to Burkman\'s home. In a later interview with CNN, he alleged that Wohl and Burkman wanted to take down Buttigieg, whom they viewed as President Trump\'s top threat in 2020.Burkman had been fixating on Buttigieg on social media. On April 22, Burkman tweeted, \"2020 is shaping up to be more exciting than 2016. Looking like it will be Trump vs. Mayor Pete! Get the popcorn ready!\" He mused on his internet radio show that Buttigieg had eclipsed Beto O\'Rourke as the star of the Democratic field.By the time Kelly arrived at Burkman\'s house it was the middle of the night, Kelly said. But they spent the pre-dawn hours Monday going over their plan anyway. Wohl showed Kelly a draft of the Medium post. Kelly said he told Wohl \"I was incredibly uncomfortable and not on board with their plan.\" It was late when Kelly went to sleep. When he woke up, around 11 a.m. Monday, he said Wohl had already posted the article under Kelly\'s name.\"Next thing I know, Jack Burkman is telling me how I am a \'star\' and people are eating me up,\" Kelly said, adding that he felt \"sick to my stomach\" about the article.Kelly accused the men of creating a fake Twitter account under his name, @realHunterKelly, and sharing the link to the article. (Twitter later suspended the account.) David Wohl, Jacob Wohl\'s father, was also quick to share it on Twitter.Reporters from mainstream news outlets saw it, and some newsrooms, including CNN, sought more information. But they held off on publishing or broadcasting anything, given that the claim was out of the blue and completely unsubstantiated.\'Politics can be ugly\'Some right-wing websites, however, ran with it right away. \"Mayor Pete Hit with #MeToo Allegation of Sexual Assault,\" InfoWars wrote. \"Democrat Darling Pete Buttigieg Accused of Sexual Assault by 21-Year-Old from Michigan,\" said The Gateway Pundit\'s headline.Around 2 p.m., three hours after the allegation was posted, Buttigieg held an unrelated Q&A with reporters in New York City. \"Mayor Pete, do you have anything to say about the allegations?\" a reporter asked.\"Oh, I\'m sure it\'s not the first time somebody\'s going to make something up about me,\" Buttigieg said. \"It\'s not going to throw us. Politics can be ugly sometimes, but you have to face that when you\'re in presidential politics.\"As Buttigieg was responding, Kelly said he was receiving hundreds of calls and messages from reporters about his claim. He returned CNN\'s call around 4 p.m. Kelly sounded nervous on the phone and said he only wanted to talk on-camera. Later, he would tell CNN that Burkman and Wohl were standing over his shoulder, forcing him to read a script.Kelly sent an address to CNN for the interview. It was Burkman\'s home, which immediately raised red flags. Burkman helped fuel the Seth Rich conspiracy theories. Last year, Burkman and Wohl had worked together to try to pin a fake sexual assault allegation on special counsel Robert Mueller. The matter was referred to the FBI for investigation.When CNN asked Kelly for some corroboration of his claims before agreeing to do an interview, Kelly didn\'t respond. Around 7:30 p.m., Kelly texted: \"I was set up.\"In a statement sent to CNN and posted to Facebook, Kelly wrote, \"It\'s important for everyone to know that I was not sexually assaulted and would never falsely accuse anyone.\"Burkman and Wohl both denied that they were part of a plot to fabricate sexual assault allegations against Buttigieg.\"I am appalled by the lies now being told in the national media,\" Burkman tweeted. \"Hunter Kelly\'s claims of \'coercion\' are absurd. He spent a pleasant day with our firm. The day included a Starbucks run, getting him to a hair salon, and playing with dogs.\"Burkman shared a photo of a statement Kelly signed describing the assault as well as a photo of Kelly posing with his Ferris State University ID. Burkman described Kelly as his \"client\" and said he was only trying to help Kelly get the story out.Wohl told CNN that Kelly \"came here to Washington. He had a very detailed story about how he was sexually assaulted by Mayor Pete Buttigieg. We vetted his allegation in a cursory way, and basically transcribed it. After which he signed onto it.\"Something more nefarious In follow-up conversations, Kelly described something more nefarious. He said he didn\'t know what to do when Wohl first presented him with the draft of the Medium post.\"It was almost four in the morning,\" Kelly said. \"I couldn\'t get kicked out because I would have had nowhere to go. By the time I woke up, security was there, and I just felt very uncomfortable.\"He said if news outlets had sent camera crews, he had a plan to expose Wohl and Burkman during the interview.\"I was going to point at both of them and say, \'I\'m being set up right now and none of this is true,\'\" Kelly said. \"I felt like that would have made them look like the liars that they are.\"Noting his misgivings, Kelly said that Burkman promised him a \"lavish lifestyle\" if he played his part in the scheme.Instead, Kelly said that he pretended to be exhausted. He said he needed a nap but instead he packed his things and waited for some of his family members to arrive. Then, Kelly said, he rushed downstairs and told Wohl he couldn\'t go through with their plan. He left the house and headed back to Michigan.CNN could not independently verify Kelly\'s story about the financial promises Burkman allegedly made or the pressure Kelly allegedly faced to go along with the plan.By both Wohl and Kelly\'s accounts, Kelly was in touch with his family throughout this saga and eventually left Burkman\'s house with family members, though Wohl claims that Kelly only retracted the allegations after he faced pressure from his family.Just before 8 p.m., The Daily Beast published a story exposing the hoax. Right-wing websites began updating their initial stories about the made-up assault allegation. By about 10 p.m., Medium removed the story that set everything in motion. It was taken down without any explanation -- perhaps because it violated the site\'s rule against deceptive content.In follow-up conversations, Kelly said he had been excited to participate in a legitimate research and political operation. He said it seemed like \"a really awesome opportunity.\"Kelly also admitted that when he agreed to hop a plane to Washington, he was already aware of the kinds of stunts Burkman and Wohl had pulled in the past. He just didn\'t believe he would ever allow himself to get sucked into one.\"I knew that I would never let that happen. But I let it happen,\" Kelly said. \"It was definitely something I wish I could take back, going out there. But I can\'t, so I\'m trying to right my wrongs, let the truth be told.\"Now, when someone searches for information about the allegation on Google, stories debunking the smear show up before the smear itself -- a small victory for Buttigieg and for the truth.--CNN Business\' Donie O\'Sullivan and Oliver Darcy contributed to this report', '1128691211', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190503173610-jacob-wohl-and-jack-burkman-super-tease.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Anatomy of a smear: How far-right websites spread a fake story about Pete Buttigieg', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1128691211.php', '(CNN)This is a story about how political operatives tried to take down a presidential candidate, and ended up just humiliating themselves.\n\nIt\'s also ....', 1, '', ''),

It\'s also home to one of the country\'s ugliest statistics: Native American people there are almost five times more likely to be reported missing than everyone else in the state.\n\nNative Americans make up only a sliver of Montana\'s total population -- less than 7% -- but accounted for 26% of all missing person reports from 2016 to 2018. Almost two-thirds of those Native Americans reported missing are women or girls.The problem is especially acute in Montana, and not at all new, but on Friday the first piece of legislation to address the issue became law when Montana Gov. Steve Bullock signed a measure known as Hanna\'s Act. The law comes at what may be a watershed moment for the national epidemic of missing and slain Native American women. There is more pending legislation in Montana, and federal lawmakers are debating their own legislation to get a grip on the problem that is little known outside the reservations. In Montana, Hanna\'s Act, named for Hanna Harris, who was killed on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in 2013, will appoint a missing person\'s \"czar\" to oversee a new database of missing people and help facilitate better communication between law enforcement agencies working on the cases. Montana State Sen. Jason Small lives on the same reservation where Harris was killed. He sponsored a second bill that aims to better get the word out on missing people within the first few days, because the vast majority of missing natives are not listed in an official federal database. Montana\'s legislature meets every two years. This year\'s session had 12 seats filled by Native American lawmakers, the most in state history. Small credits that and the 2017 film \"Wind River\" for raising awareness of the problem and spurring legislative action.

Harding, who goes by her middle name, Blue, went missing on July 23, 2018, from Billings, Montana. Harding had struggled with addiction and was in and out of a teen crisis center. Her mother, Tamera Bearcomesout knew she was missing days after she was last seen, but because she had disappeared and come back before, she didn\'t file an official missing person\'s report until almost a month later, thinking Harding would turn up eventually. She never did. Bearcomesout said it \"felt like they quit trying\" after the Yellowstone County Sheriff\'s Office learned Harding allegedly had traded sex for drugs before. \"Regardless of her past, or her addiction, she\'s still my daughter, still my baby,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"I\'m just hoping that something will be done. It\'s getting too long.\"Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said his office is still following every lead that comes in, including at least one reported sighting in recent months and reports that Harding had communicated on Facebook since her disappearance. He denied her lifestyle affected the investigation. \"That\'s absolutely not the case. We\'re not judging people,\" he said. \"Her history does not determine how hard we try.\"Help came far too late for 14-year-old Henny Scott, who went missing from the Northern Cheyenne Reservation on December 7, 2018. She had called home from a friend\'s house to ask if she could attend a weekend basketball tournament in Billings. She was told to come home, but \"she never showed up,\" said her mother, Paula Castro-Stops, who was clearly emotional as she recounted that phone call. On December 9, Castro-Stops posted on Facebook that her daughter was missing. Four days later she filed an official missing person\'s report with law enforcement on the neighboring Crow Reservation, where she believed Henny may have been. The media was alerted December 26, 17 days after Henny was reported missing. Her body was found on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation near the town of Lame Deer on December 28, about 100 yards away from the house she had called from. The FBI is investigating, but there have been no charges filed. \"We\'ve kind of lost a little bit of hope, but I\'m praying there is [justice],\" said Castro-Stops. The Crow Bureau of Indian Affairs, which handles law enforcement on that reservation, did not return calls for comment. Castro-Stops said police agencies were slow to share information with one another, if at all. She said Montana\'s new laws would have been helpful at the time of Henny\'s disappearance. \"If [police] had of put it out there right away, more people would have known,\" she said. \"I was just using Facebook.\"Small, the state senator sponsoring some of the legislation, said the Henny Scott case is a prime example of jurisdictional issues between tribal police, federal Bureau of Indian Affairs agents, and non-Native American local and state police failing to adequately communicate. \"It\'s really just a huge messy situation,\" he said.Castro-Stops thinks the issue runs much deeper than jurisdictional quagmires. \"I believe they use that as an excuse,\" she said. \"We\'re a minority who don\'t have many resources.\"\'Indian Country is not mainstream media\'This week, US Rep. Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat and a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, introduced the Not Invisible Act in the US House of Representatives. She was joined by three other members of Congress who are Native American tribe members, making it the first congressional bill in history to be introduced by four members of federally recognized tribes.If passed, the Not Invisible Act will get victims, tribal leaders, federal agencies and law enforcement in the same room to recommend solutions to the plague of missing and slain Native American women. Haaland, who is co-chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus, also plans to introduce separate legislation that aims to count the number of missing and killed Native Americans. One estimate from the National Crime Information Center shows 5,712 reports of missing Native American women in 2016 alone, though reliable data is difficult to come by.Last year, Washington state passed a similar law that requires the state patrol to count the number of missing and killed Native American women. Their first report is due in June. What took Congress so long to do something about a problem that goes back decades? \"It\'s no one\'s fault,\" said Haaland, explaining that lawmakers before her have had all kinds of priorities, though it certainly helps now that there are four Native Americans in Congress, the highest number on record. \"There\'s so many issues in Indian country that nobody knows about. Indian country is not mainstream media.\" She half-joked that the most mainstream media attention Native Americans get is \"When the President calls Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas,\" a reference to the Massachusetts senator who once identified herself as Cherokee, despite lacking tribal enrollment or an identifiable Native American relative. \"I think that the attention that will be paid [to missing Native Americans] as a result of the bill will help generate the kinds of questions we need to solve these issues,\" Haaland said, acknowledging that her legislation is only the beginning of an effort to end what she calls a \"crisis\" that\'s gone on for too long.\n\nCNN\'s Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.', '1127649752', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190502183820-02-montana-missing-natives-super-tease.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Native Americans are more likely to be reported missing than others.

Here are our favorite printers', 'The printer has become commonplace in the tech world and certainly isn\'t going away. As companies are pushing consumers to use tablets and computers, paper and the ink upon it, have powered their way through. Chances are, if you made it here, you\'re looking for a new printer, or at least want to see what makes a printer a printer in 2019.\n\nWell, you\'re in the right place. I\'ve tested several printers, from inkjet to lasers. Plus, large and small all-in-ones and HP\'s Tango X, a \"smart printer\" complete with voice control. Oh, and of course, printers that swap traditional cartridges for liquid ink that sits in tanks.\n\nNo matter the technology, the main goal is, of course, to print. You might need to print directions, photos, a shopping list, an essay, a contract or even a crossword puzzle. Printers are trusted with a lot, and if they don\'t work, it\'s never fun. Fortunately, printers are faster, better connected and boast overall better print quality in 2019.\n\nTypically, when you walk into a big box retailer or search for printers on an online store, you\'ll most likely be presented with an all-in-one, or at least a two-in-one printer. Of course, all printers can handle printing a basic page in either black and white or color. These units might also be able to handle duplexing (double-sided printing), scanning to a thumb drive or a connected PC, making copies and even printing photos.\n\nTypically an all-in-one can print, copy and scan. Some of these also feature a fax function, which requires a telephone line, but this is a bit of old school tech now. If you\'re looking for a printer that takes up less space or maybe one for a dorm room, a single print unit might be the best option.\n\nThe two main printing techniques that consumer and business models opt for are either inkJet or laser. The first makes use of cartridges; generally, a few paired in one setup that gently push out ink in small amounts to create an image or text on a sheet. It can drop minimal amounts of color or black ink on a sheet in a quick turnaround, but these aren\'t the fastest printers on the market. Just as important, each manufacturer (HP vs. Canon vs. Brother vs. Epson) uses a proprietary method to print, so results will vary.\n\nIf you\'re all right with just black and white, laser is a trusted option by many offices and schools. These larger units can quickly turn out many pages, especially if they\'re just text. Monochrome is usually the only option, especially for the price conscious. Color laser printers aren\'t as scarce as they once were, but they still cost more than a monochrome printer.\n\nA relevant term if you want to be able to print from your phone, tablet or laptop is \"WiFi Direct\" -- although it\'s not a deal breaker if your model doesn\'t have this. If it does, you\'ll pair that printer with a network. Android phones and iOS both allow you to print. From hitting the share button on either OS, you can easily send a photo, email or even a webpage to a connected printer. And yes, you can set it to color or black and white, double or single sided and set the range of pages. It makes the experience of printing anywhere, really a reality.\n\nIf \"WiFi Direct\" isn\'t supported, but your printer has an ethernet port, you can connect it to an access point or WiFi router to manually add it to the network. Mileage might vary on this, but generally, if it doesn\'t take the connection, the manufacturer should offer drivers to fix it.\n\nWith the details and intricacies of printers out of the way, let\'s dive into our recommendations. We\'ve tested several models from a broad range of makers. Here are our favorites.\n\nHP is a big and historic brand in the world of computing, including the printer space. Its latest ENVY Photo model pushes the line further with better quality prints at several sizes, while maximizing on space. I like the fact that the tray will automatically open so your pages won\'t fall on the ground. It keeps the necessary functions, like printing, copying and scanning. You can also send scans to a connected computer or save them to a flash drive or SD card, thanks to an abundance of ports.\n\nWith built-in WiFi, you can add the printer to your network for printing from almost any device. Additionally, the HP Smart app gives you more control and the ability to send requests to the printer when off the network. You can also use HP Instant Ink, which is a subscription service that monitors your ink levels and usage habits to make sure you have a new cartridge before you run out. Plus at $100 off, the ENVY Photo 7800 is super affordable at just under $130.\n\nThe next change to printing comes with the ink. Rather than standard ink cartridges, this has supersized ink tanks. Out of the box, Epson says you can expect around two years of ink, or up to 4,000 pages. That\'s essentially equivalent to around 20 three-ink cartridge sets, so safe to say, that\'s a lot of ink. You\'ll manually install the ink, which comes in bottles. It\'s a little weird at first, but not that bad, and you get more for the money. Rounding out the Eco-Tank 2650 is the ability to print, scan and copy. Plus, it has built-in WiFi and a nice 1.44-inch LCD.\n\nEpson isn\'t the only one using tanks. Brother\'s MFC-J995DW INKvestment Tank All-in-One unit is perfect for the home office. At just $199.99, and with around a year of ink in the box, you\'ll be set for a while. Especially when you realize it can handle printing several types of paper (like A4, legal, executive, photo, index cards and envelopes). It can handle up to 20 sheets in a document feeder for easy scanning or copying of large paper sets. With WiFi, ethernet, NFC (near field communications) and plenty of ports, you can print from almost any device.\n\nYou might think this printer looks like a book, and if you do, HP\'s designers will be happy. The team behind the Tango X wanted to make it disappear and fit a millennial or Gen-Z lifestyle. It\'s a pint-sized printer that can be put away when it\'s not in use by closing the foldable fabric cover. The Tango X can handle printing, and via the companion HP Smart App, you can scan or copy with it. This printer is also pretty speedy and features no screen on it, just a few LED lights. Case and point, it\'s a super minimalistic design that works well.\n\nHP also added smart features, such as the ability to control the Tango X via Amazon Alexa, the Google Assistant and Microsoft\'s Cortana. It\'s a smart printer, and if you go in with that mindset, I think you\'ll enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you miss the days of Polaroids and being able to instantly print your photos, the Canon IVY mobile mini is a good option. It\'s a relatively small printer that connects to your phone (iOS or Android) via Bluetooth. You also print on ZINK paper, which means the ink and colors are on the paper itself, not in the printer. The IVY will use heat to print the image on the easy-to-create peel and stick prints.', '1125313981', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190430152140-underscored-best-printers-lead-super-tease.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Cartridges or liquid tanks?

Andelman, Executive Director of The RedLines Project, is a contributor to CNN where his columns won the Deadline Club Award for Best Opinion Writing. Author of \"A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today,\"and translator of \"An Impossible Dream: Reagan Gorbachev and a World Without the Bomb,\" he was formerly a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nParis (CNN)In June 1974, I rented a room in a lovely bungalow in the village of Vallauris in the hills above Cannes, the same town of stone cottages and tiled roofs where Picasso had maintained his pottery studio. I was furiously at work on my second book, but that summer happened to be particularly dismal for an asthma sufferer.\n\nMy little apartment gave onto a beautiful little garden filled with plants, which unfortunately only intensified my symptoms. My rescue inhaler was the powerful stimulant and bronchodilator epinephrine, and I was using it so frequently that I began to develop heart palpitations. I was pretty scared.I unburdened myself to my landlords, who pointed out that a new young doctor from Paris had just opened a practice in the village. He took one look at my epinephrine inhaler and shook his head angrily. \"That stuff will kill you,\" he said. Then he pulled out a new, blue inhaler -- Ventolin. \"Try this,\" he said. \"It\'s the latest and it won\'t affect your heart.\" He wrote a prescription.It was a miracle. A whole new world opened for me. For the first time in memory, I could breathe freely. I imagined how different my life as an asthmatic child would have been. I went back a week later and told the doctor how well it had worked. He smiled knowingly. But he cautioned I would not find it in the US, as it had not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The active component of Ventolin, salbutamol, became commercially available in Britain in 1969. But the FDA would not approve it for sale in the United States more than a decade, until 1981.Read MoreSome New York asthma specialists would drive to Canada, taking out the side panels of their cars to smuggle back the drug for their patients, my regular pulmonologist told me.I bought enough in France to last me until my next foreign assignment in Southeast Asia for The New York Times. It was early 1975, when I walked into a pharmacy in Bangkok and asked for Ventolin. The pharmacist pointed casually to a shelf where there were piles of them. It was available over the counter -- six years before it could be prescribed legally in the United Sates.The rationale, of course, was that American authorities were simply more cautious, waiting for results from many more tests before releasing most drugs to the public. But the reality was that a vast bureaucracy had grown up and was setting a glacial pace of drug approval, virtually without Congressional guidance.Matters have improved somewhat since then. Drugs today can go to market with special fast-track procedures that dramatically accelerate the approval process and I am able to find the three asthma drugs that I take every day in many US pharmacies. But the new obstacle is price.Late last year, I had a rude awakening when I walked into Duane Read on Lexington Avenue in New York and ordered a renewal of my prescription for one of my asthma drugs. The bill? $450 for three months\' supply.That was just the copay. Without a private drug plan, the real cost of my daily medicine Advair would be closer to full retail price of $1,263, or $5,052 for one year.But that was nothing like my shock upon walking into the tiny pharmacy near the Musée d\'Orsay in Paris, a week later. There, a three-month supply for Advair was the equivalent of $125. Had I been a French taxpayer, it could have been free. The stakes are high for me: Both of my uncles died in their sixties from asthma, more than 20 years ago. I\'ve made it to 74 and am thriving -- but I need these drugs to stay alive. So I had to know: How does France keep drug prices so low?The United States is currently searching its soul about its sky-high local drug prices, highlighted in government hearings over the cost of insulin -- a life-or-death treatment for diabetics. As the larger debate over US healthcare veers between advocates of French-style universal health care (known in the US as \"Medicare-for-All\') and those who want to erase even Obamacare\'s modest government controls, it\'s worth taking note of the French system.The short answer for the drug price disparity is that France has enormous bargaining power with drug manufacturers. The French government runs the country\'s universal healthcare program, which makes it by far the largest purchaser for most drugs. So when it sets price ceilings for drug-makers; those limits generally hold.The resulting cheaper prices at the pharmacy don\'t just make life easier for consumers like me. Lower prices from the outset also mean that France\'s entire healthcare system carries a lighter financial burden.Asked about French and US prices for Advair, its maker, global pharma company GlaxoSmithKline attributed the gap to \"fundamental differences in healthcare systems and countries around the world [that] make price comparisons very difficult and potentially misleading,\" spokeswoman Kristen Neese told me in an e-mail. Neese also warned that French-style centralized price regulation \"results in restricted access to medicines and fewer choices for patients.\" But the US is one of the world\'s largest markets for prescription drugs, which makes the government\'s potential bargaining power enormous. If the US began regulating drug prices -- or even ultimately serving as the only real customer under some sort of prescription-drugs-for all plan -- it\'s unlikely that major pharmaceutical companies would risk turning their backs on all those potential sales -- even if at lower profits than they\'re used to.Bringing the US government\'s negotiating power to bear on drug prices would be a huge first step in helping people who don\'t have the kind of health insurance that make my lifestyle possible. But it doesn\'t have to start in Washington, DC. A major private entity could step in as well -- imagine the possibilities if Amazon, with its recent purchase of PillPack, decided to use the full force of its negotiating power for the benefit of its 100 million Prime members.Doesn\'t US President Donald Trump love negotiations where he has the upper hand? And surely Jeff Bezos?', '1125067739', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190429193631-02-french-pharmacy-super-tease.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'The French solution to US drug prices', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1125067739.php', 'Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Find out what\'s happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nNairobi, Kenya (CNN)Every Sunday morning in an affluent suburb of Nairobi, Kenya, the soaring song of Chinese hymns fills the empty corridors of a Monday-to-Friday office block.\n\nInside a small makeshift chapel, a kaleidoscopic congregation of Chinese migrants gather to pray. Among them are underwear importers, health workers and operators of the controversial new $3.8 billion Chinese-built railway that slices through Kenya, the country\'s biggest infrastructure project since independence -- and a sign of China\'s growing investment and footprint on the continent. Some have married Kenyans, others have Chinese children who speak Swahili as well as they do Mandarin. But they all share two things. Each person here has re-rooted their life from Communist China to Kenya, a leading African economy where 80% of the nearly 50 million people are Christian. And they have all decided to openly embrace God. Their religious awakening comes at a perilous moment for Christians in China, as the Communist Party government bans online sales of bibles, dynamites churches and arrests Christians for \"inciting subversion of state power.\" The Communist Party sees any large group outside its dominion as a threat.Read More\"Publicly, it\'s dangerous to be a Christian in China right now,\" says Jonathon Chow, 43, a senior pastor at the Bread of Life Church, which is headquartered in Taiwan but has 500 ministries, including many in West Africa. Previously, the organization\'s churches in Africa tended to be run and attended by Africans, he says. But increasingly Bread of Life is seeing Chinese-led congregations forming across the continent, as more Chinese move to Africa and interact with local values. The Golden Lampstand Church, in China, was demolished with dynamite and heavy machinery in January 2018.Throughout the service, a middle-aged couple from Shandong province, who say they are new to Kenya and the ministry, post audio clips of hymns and photographs of readings onto WeChat, a social network closely monitored by the Chinese government. \"Most of the congregation here got saved in Kenya,\" says Chow. \"Unless they were a believer before they came, most don\'t know a lot about the Christian conditions in China.\" \'The Kenyan wedding everyone is talking about\'The first time Liang Yongyu met Karen Ngunjiri at the billboard advertising company where they both worked in Nairobi, he told her she would be his wife. The pair dated for 6 months, then hit a roadblock that threatened to scupper his swaggering prediction. Liang, 33, was not a Christian. \"That was a deal breaker for me,\" says Ngunjiri, 29, who spent four years studying Mandarin in Nanning, south-west China. \"Him being Chinese? Not a problem. But him not being a Christian, I thought that was going to be a big issue. How would we bring up our children?\" Liang had lived in Kenya for a \"long time,\" could speak some Swahili and had been \"hearing a lot about Christianity\" from his Kenyan friends, Ngunjiri says. After some soul searching, he said he \"was open to exploring what Christianity had to offer,\" she adds.Liang connected with a church in Nairobi that held services in Cantonese -- the language spoken in his home province of Guangdong, in southern China, and Hong Kong, where the pastors who founded the ministry were from.In December 2018, those Hong Kong pastors married the couple in a Christian ceremony in the shadow of Mount Kenya in front of 200 guests -- \"a small wedding for Kenya,\" jokes Ngunjiri.Weeks later, a video of their wedding went viral on YouTube with the title: \"THE KENYAN WEDDING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT.\" Ngunjiri still doesn\'t know who uploaded it, but for months the newlyweds couldn\'t walk down the street in Nairobi without being recognized. The novelty of a Kenyan woman marrying a Chinese man had got people\'s attention.\"Some of the comments (online) were horrible,\" she says, of the video that has since been taken down, but at its peak had nearly 300,000 views, according to Ngunjiri. \"Especially from Kenyans. There\'s this idea that the Chinese are here to steal our jobs or colonize us. So the joke was now they\'re stealing our women.\"In 2017, China was Kenya\'s largest trading partner and, in 2014, the country was home to an estimated 40,000 Chinese migrants. But their relations with Kenyans have, at times, been tense. In 2015, a Chinese restaurateur reportedly banned African patrons after 5 p.m., last year a Chinese boss was deported from Kenya after being caught on video calling an employee a \"monkey,\" and local media has claimed that Kenyan workers on the Chinese-built railway have been treated like second-class citizens by their foreign employers. Kenyans are also concerned about how much debt their country owes to China. Last year, in a seeming show of strength against Chinese dominance President Kenyatta Uhuru banned imports of cheap Chinese fish, amid claims it was squeezing out local produce. But his ban was soon reversed: Kenya does not produce enough fish to feed itself. Kenyan workers on the Standard Gauge Railway; Chinese supervisors on the platform in Nairobi; Kenyan staff man the modern terminal.The anti-Chinese commentators on Ngunjiri\'s wedding video, however, had perhaps missed the point. Rather than Ngunjiri being overpowered by Chinese culture, it was Liang who had changed his faith and agreed to a Christian African wedding with just 20 Chinese guests who didn\'t include his mother, embracing a new culture 5,300 miles from home. A new door opens An estimated 1 million Chinese have moved to the African continent in the 21st century, according to journalist Howard French\'s book \"China\'s Second Continent,\" amid growing trade ties between the two regions. But what is perhaps unique about Kenya\'s Chinese population, and why it is embracing the country\'s religious culture, is its diversity. A 2015 study found the Chinese in Kenya are spread \"across every sector in a significant way.\" This makes a difference. Employees of government-owned giants, shipped out to build roads in Uganda or airports in Zimbabwe, for example, are typically bused to and from work and must stay inside their compounds in the evenings and at weekends unless given approval to leave by a manager. But in Nairobi -- a vibrant city home to African tech giant M-Pesa, which revolutionized mobile banking in East Africa -- a younger generation of Chinese are working in the private sector, freer to explore new cultures and belief systems through their personal connections with local people. Annie Hu, 30, began attending church in Kenya; Chinese and Kenyan employees mix at a media company office; the China Center where many Chinese expats have businesses.Among them is Annie Hu, 30, who relocated to Kenya five years ago and works as East Africa region manager for a Chinese financial technology, or fintech, giant. She says the 9-to-5 \"pole pole\" (meaning \"slowly slowly\" in Swahili) lifestyle here is more attractive than the9-9-6 grind -- working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week -- at some of China\'s biggest technology companies in the country\'s Silicon Valley city of Shenzhen, where she relocated from. \"Living in a developing country and international city you encounter different nationalities, races and lifestyles,\" Hu says. After frequently traveling for work to the Muslim majority city of Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, she went to Lebanon and Jordan last year to learn more about Islamic culture. \"It opened a totally new door for me,\" she says. Perhaps reflecting on how her own country treats Muslims, she diplomatically adds: \"We need more understanding.\"Hu\'s family is Buddhist but in Nairobi she began attending Christian churches, including Bread of Life and the Cantonese congregation joined by Liang, as well as a Maasai church. \"Kenyans believe in God more than my Western friends,\" she says. \"Once we engage with the local community it\'s inevitable we are invited to join the church. These people are very friendly and reliable and they try to build a supportive community for the Chinese.\" Chow from Bread of Life agrees the church is an important social network for newcomers. \"I also think the cultural differences and the hardship the Chinese experience here means they are more open to the gospel,\" he says. For Hu, flirting with various Christian communities hasn\'t yet resulted in a full conversion, although she doesn\'t rule it out. \"It\'s brought more religion into my life,\" she says, \"but I didn\'t get to the point where I want to be a Christian yet.\"The world\'s biggest Christian nation?It is not only the Chinese in Kenya who are embracing Christianity. Many Chinese students in America, Australia and the UK are returning home Christian, says Ian Johnson, author of \"The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao.\" Their conversion chimes with a broader trend at home: China itself is on track to be the world\'s biggest Christian nation by 2030, by some estimates. For much of the 20th century, Chinese citizens were taught to worship the founding father of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, the revolutionary leader who destroyed much of the nation\'s Buddhist and Taoist religious infrastructure during the Cultural Revolution. \"There used to be 900 temples in Beijing alone,\" says Johnson. \"Now there are 20.\" Mao\'s death in 1976 left the Chinese searching for a new value system. Christianity seemed fresh and modern to the country\'s newly urban residents, Johnson says, although more people in China are still Buddhist. By 2017, there were between 93 million and 115 million Christians in China -- around 5% of the country\'s population -- but fewer than 30 million practice in official churches, according to Purdue University scholar Yang Fenggang.

I think he gives us a lot of things. He is an example for us.\n\n\"We have to improve and keep working with him because he can give a lot and he is a very good guy on and off the pitch.\"\n\nKompany\'s sensational strike came as City piled on the pressure in the second half, knowing anything less than a 13th successive league win would hand the initiative to Liverpool heading into the final fixtures.\n\nThey now know victory over Brighton on Sunday will see them become the first back-to-back title winners in a decade, regardless of how Liverpool fare against Wolves.\n\nLaporte said: \"We are focused on us. It is the most important. We have to win every single game and if we win the next game, we are the champions.\"\n\nKompany, whose contract is up in the summer, shed a few tears as he set out on the end-of-season lap of honour ahead of his teammates, but does not want to retire.\n\n\"I do not know at this point,\" Kompany told Sky Sports when asked about his future after the match.\n\nREAD ALSO: Lagos seizes poisonous ponmo worth N10m, inaugurates panel\n\nAsked if he will retire, the Belgian said: \"Absolutely not. I am going to play.\"\n\nGuardiola\'s regard for Kompany\'s experience has been clear in recent weeks, with the veteran selected for each of the past three league games, against Manchester United, Burnley and Leicester, with their title hopes on the line.\n\nBut the City boss was equally non-committal on Kompany\'s future.\n\n\"At the end of the season we are going to talk to him,\" said Guardiola on whether Kompany will be handed a new deal.\n\n\"He is an incredible human being.

(342, '2019-05-09 16:13:26', 'punchng.com', 'lifestyle', 'Talk is cheap: Popular beliefs that harm Nigeria', 'Many of us use popular expressions and harbour beliefs that we take as the absolute truth. A little scratch below the surface will reveal something different though. Some popular assertions actually make one wonder if we think through what we say, or those beliefs that inform our action. It\'s where the challenge is - beliefs that inform action. I call attention to three examples. They sound true; but they are fundamentally flawed, negatively influencing us and this nation in ways we don\'t reckon with.\n\nThe first example is the saying that \"facts are sacred, but talk is cheap\". In her response to a question on a popular TV programme a few days ago, there was this lady who said, \"Facts are sacred, but opinion is cheap\". She said it, like most Nigerians do, with a negative nuance, an attempt to dismiss others. This lady, in particular, rendered it with gusto, like one who suddenly realised she had reached the best point in an intervention. But talk, opinion, or commentary could be expensive. For instance, we know that one carefree comment can set a whole nation on fire. I think the negative purposes for which public officials in Nigeria also invoke \"talk is cheap\" harm this nation. Why? Officials adopt the saying when they want to deride a critic, rather than respond persuasively to their criticism regarding how this nation is run. They aren\'t alone. Private citizens who think their views must always be the only views in town do the same. This forms the second example.\n\nNot long ago, a professor (Nigerian) was on TV deriding some other person\'s comment. He belittled the person\'s view by saying it was just a comment, not an analysis. The undisguised nuance in this professor\'s comment is that the opinion of the other person is nothing, his own academic analysis is everything. It\'s another way of saying \"talk is cheap.\" This professor\'s tone was scornful, indicating that he had no regard for whatever the other person had to say even when that person, who was much younger, had addressed him with respect. Surely, age and high academic attainment have nothing to do with wisdom and balanced judgment.\n\nFirst, I consider this professor\'s comment a trip in ego-serving. He thinks he\'s the wisest thing on earth. There isn\'t any recognition in his comment that he thinks the other person is making a point whatsoever, even if he disagrees with that point. This is intolerance, narrow-mindedness and lack of respect for others.\n\nMeanwhile, that one is a professor doesn\'t mean one has all the answers. One\'s only an expert in the area in which one has conducted research, beyond that one\'s a neophyte. Many with the mindset that this professor has are in high places, taking decisions for us. I think it\'s one reason our country has some of the issues it\'s contending with. People in high positions think other persons\' views are irrelevant, those who offer a different opinions are enemies. We know the extensive damage an intolerant, know-it-all person in authority can to the public good.\n\nThe third example is the belief that drives the popular assertion that when public officers aren\'t adequately paid, they would steal what is in their charge. People repeat this in the public space as though it\'s a law of gravity. I think this argument emboldens people who have no qualms about taking what doesn\'t belong to them. I once addressed this (The PUNCH, June 1, 2018) at the time when a servant of God repeated the assertion on TV. He had said because public officers would steal if they weren\'t adequately paid, he had begun to teach people how to have multiple streams of income. He didn\'t categorically condemn stealing so I took his comment as an encouragement to looters. He seems to forget that no amount of money is ever enough for any human being; money is never enough for people who have the disposition to take what is not theirs. An example was a former Nigerian military Head of State who was simply looting our treasury and hiding billions of dollars in foreign accounts. Also, I think if a person who proclaims a religion takes what doesn\'t belong to him, he has no religion. We know the teachings of a religion can arrest the hearts of listeners, making them avoid what doesn\'t belong to them. But here\'s a servant of God who wants to use human/physical solution to cure what, from religious point of view, is effectively a heart problem. It won\'t work. In any case, public officials who take what doesn\'t belong to them do because it\'s available. It\'s the reason I\'m for every measure which ensures that public officials don\'t have the opportunity to steal.\n\nNow that the three examples are cited, I return to the original point regarding the quote: \"Facts are sacred, but talk is cheap\". The main intention is to condemn the negative uses to which it has been largely deployed in Nigeria, as well as point out that in reality talk isn\'t cheap.\n\nRegarding this I use talk, opinion and commentary interchangeably. Talk or talking is costly. For instance, it is for the purpose of expressing opinions that media houses have talk shows. What many dismiss as mere talk now draws adverts which earn big money. Through these talk shows, the public is better informed. We know that an uninformed public is a challenge to a nation, and it has costly consequences.\n\nI\'ve been expressing opinion in newspapers since 2003. Before then, my commentaries were read on the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, Ibadan Network Station. Over the years, people said to me how encouraged, re-assured, or better informed they were by some of my views. With university degrees earned at three different levels in Political Science, I suppose I could write using academic jargons in the name of doing analysis. But I choose simplicity of expression instead. I think I would strongly disagree with any professor who imagines that because I don\'t deploy academic terms like him then he can sarcastically dismiss me with, \"Talk is cheap\".\n\nWhen some deride others with \"talk is cheap\", I take it that it\'s because we tend to be superficial regarding our beliefs. We forget that talking was all that King Solomon of ancient Israel did, creatively and wisely giving expression to mundane things, and he was considered the wisest king on earth in his generation. This king didn\'t engage in complex scientific research to get his facts. He wasn\'t a university professor. But he had a brilliant mind and gave wisdom-filled expressions to what he thought. In order to hear Solomon talk, wealthy people brought their wealth to him. Like Solomon, many in our time live on the high end just by talking in the right places. Talk isn\'t cheap.\n\nRunning a commentary isn\'t cheap also. Commentators at sporting events earn big money in advanced countries. They\'re different from sports analysts who sit in the studios of media houses. No one enjoys a football match on TV when there\'s no commentator. Commentators on politics or public affairs outside our shores earn huge fees too, and their views are respected. It\'s only in Nigeria that public officials dismiss public affairs analysts with the cliché, \"talk is cheap\".\n\nNot long ago, President Donald Trump of the US was compelled to declare a state of emergency regarding the building of a wall along the US-Mexico border. Why? Commentators on pro-Trump major TV news channels said if the president must fulfill one of his campaign promises, it was the only way to go in the face of opposition from the Congress. Commentators on major US media outlets are highly paid and their opinions influence millions of Americans during elections.\n\nMoreover, it\'s opinion that prestigious private organisations want to hear when they invite US\'s ex-presidents to address them. These presidents aren\'t paid to attend such engagements only to engage in some high-sounding academic analyses. What is paid for is their high-profile presence that draws attention, the respect for the opinion they hold as former presidents. Meanwhile, when private organisations want academic rigour, they know the prestigious academic institutions to approach. Nevertheless, an ex-US president\'s opinion earns him much more fees for the same session than what a university professor earns.

If you haven\'t checked out the game yourself, this is a PvP sports title, where two teams of three face off in a game that\'s part roller derby, part basketball, part rugby, all set in the future it seems. The goal of each team is to take the ball around the oval at least once and then attempt to shoot it through a sideways ring placed up high like a basketball hoop to score a point. But if you manage to take the ball around the court more than once, you can earn more points depending on how often you do it. You can pass the ball to any teammate during these revolutions, but the other team is there ready to steal the ball or knock you over and take it from you to do the same. It\'s a fast-paced event that reminded us of Rocket League in terms of unpredictability, skill, and excitement.\n\nThe session I went into was actually a weird one as I was partnered up with several Twitch streamers who were broadcasting their interactions with the game live from E3. Since I don\'t stream professionally, I was the odd one out of the group not talking to an audience, so I decided to have some fun and see what the game would allow me to do. I decided to take a more offensive approach when it came to preventing the other team from scoring by going around the track the opposite way, blocking shots and tackling people as they came around the corner. My favorite part was nailing the ball carrier square-on as they sped up toward me, and hearing from a few booths over \"No, that ain\'t right! That ain\'t right!\" It was glorious. Roller Champions has a lot of potential as a fixture on Twitch, and the thing basically has esports written all over it. It\'s just a matter of time after it launches.

If there was one game we had to get out of this alliance, that was it.\n\nSadly, it didn\'t work out.\n\nNever fear, football denizens. By December, we may have forgotten all about that lost mega-matchup anyway.\n\nThat\'s because the 2019 CIAC football playoff divisions have been released, and your biggest takeaway: It doesn\'t look like Hand\'s road to a third-straight Class L will be so rosy.\n\nDrew Pyne and New Canaan, last year\'s Class LL runners up, have been dropped back to Class L after a year away.\n\nAnd -- and -- perennial state champion St. Joseph, which comes in having won back-to-back titles in Class S (2017) and Class M (2018), will be competing in Class L, too.\n\nHello.\n\nAdd those developments in with John Marinelli\'s sudden departure as Greenwich\'s head coach -- creating some uncertainty, if not a power vacuum in Class LL -- and, suddenly, the Class L playoffs are looking boss in 2019.\n\nWhew.

But since the Hogs have won consecutive state championships, they\'ve been bumped up one class, from M to L.\n\nSame goes for Killingly, which is designated as a school of choice for its vo-ag program. The Redmen won the Class M title two years ago and reached last year\'s M semifinals. Therefore, Killingly, a Class S school by enrollment, is once again bumped up to Class M.\n\nBerlin, a choice school which has reached the Class M semifinals the past two years, has also been bumped up to Class L.\n\nThose aren\'t the only three programs affected by the success modifier for 2019.\n\nOther intriguing moves include:\n\nClass L semifinalist Platt and RHAM both dropping down to Class M; Hillhouse moving back up to Class L from M; Sheehan, Ledyard and Coginchaug/Hale Ray/East Hampton moving down from Class M to Class S and Valley Regional/Old Lyme moving back up to M.

You just always have to have a good attitude and do the best you can at everything else. If you\'re having a really good game then that\'s just a plus.\n\n\"I just let the game come to me, but obviously if I feel like I have a mismatch and I can keep attacking that mismatch, I\'m going to do what I need to do to help the team win.\"\n\nOn if he expects more offers to come in: \"I think some more offers will be coming, but...if I don\'t get anymore, it\'s not a big deal. I\'m not going to try and go get hundreds of offers, because I don\'t know if I need to do that... My mindset has been if I\'m good enough, they\'ll come find me. That\'s been the advice I\'ve been told and I\'ve been sticking to it.\"\n\nOn setting a timetable: \"I\'ve thought about it, but as of right now, everything\'s wide open. That\'s what I\'ve been telling coaches.

He has been battling to clear his name ever since.\n\nBlatter told AFP he was \"completely surprised\" at Platini\'s questioning by police, adding that \"this won\'t help him\" coming as it does months before the end of his ban.\n\n\"With this story resurfacing at a time when the international media are in France for the Women\'s World Cup and three months before the end of his suspension it\'s astonishing and fodder for the media,\" Blatter said.', '1166328125', 'http://images1.naharnet.com/images/223110/w140.jpg?1560950595', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Platini Released in 2022 World Cup Probe, Denies Wrongdoing', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1166328125.php', 'The banned ex-UEFA chief Michel Platini was released from custody on Wednesday after hours of questioning in connection with a criminal investigation ....', 0, 'null', 'null'),

This is a big deal for the Canadians, as they have never advanced from the group stage when not playing in North America.\n\nCanadian soccer superstar Christine Sinclair came close in the match against New Zealand, striking the post but not getting a goal. It was up to Jessie Fleming and Nichelle Prince to put Canada up 2-0 against the New Zealand side to earn their second victory of the tournament. Those two second-half goals helped the Canadians cement their spot in the upcoming round of 16.\n\nMuch like in their first game against Cameroon, the Canadian side dominated play throughout the game but struggled to get many chances to score.

U.S. Soccer Fans Have to Pick a Lane', 'While the U.S. women are defending their World Cup title, the U.S. men are aiming to win the Gold Cup By Laine Higgins Laine Higgins The Wall Street Journal BiographyLaine Higgins @lainehiggins17 laine.higgins@wsj.com June 19, 2019 8:03 am ET\n\nAmerican soccer fans are facing a dilemma this summer: too much soccer. And neither the fans nor the players are too happy about it.\n\nThe problem: At the exact moment when the U.S. women are defending their 2015 World Cup title in France, their male counterparts are launching a defense of their 2017 win in the regional Gold Cup tournament. The title games of the two tournaments are on the same day, July 7, a few hours apart.\n\nSoccer officials have tried to sell this as a potentially historic day for U.S. soccer, if both national teams make it to their respective title matches. \"It would be an incredible day of soccer,\" said U.S. Soccer\'s Senior Manager of Communications Neil Buethe.\n\nBut no one else is very happy about it. U.S. fans have had to choose between going to France to support the women\'s team or staying home to support the men. And many -- especially the players -- believe the women\'s World Cup simply deserves its own moment clear of competition.\n\n\"It\'s ridiculous. And disappointing, to be honest,\" said Megan Rapinoe, forward and captain of the USWNT.\n\nThe last time the two international tournaments coincided four years ago, they were played in subsequent summer months. This year, the action takes place simultaneously.\n\nHow did this year\'s overlapping tournaments happen?\n\nScheduling for major championships begins and ends with FIFA, the governing body of international soccer. FIFA picked the dates for this summer\'s tournaments over 18 months ago and announced the schedule for the Women\'s World Cup in February 2018. Concacaf released the Gold Cup schedule about eight months later in October 2018.\n\nExecutives at U.S. Soccer and Fox, which owns the multimillion-dollar broadcasting rights to both of this summer\'s tournaments, asked Concacaf to consider moving the men\'s final, which also coincides with the South American regional Copa América championship game, to Saturday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Concacaf declined.\n\n\"The decision was taken after exhaustive consultation with key stakeholders and broadcasting rights partners,\" said Concacaf in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. \"Concacaf trusts that the FIFA Women\'s World Cup in France and our Gold Cup, the games of which will be broadcast in different time slots, will complement each other well.\"\n\nLater, Concacaf president Victor Montagliani was more concise. \"It was simply an error,\" he told Sports Illustrated. \"Ultimately [FIFA] are the masters of the calendar and maybe somebody fell asleep at the switch.\"\n\nThe overlapping schedules has given U.S. soccer fans whiplash. Ray Noriega of American Outlaws, U.S. Soccer\'s official support group, has traveled to every Summer Olympics and Women\'s World Cup since 2011 to watch the USWNT. When he saw the schedule for this summer, he was incredulous.\n\n\"You couldn\'t move it one day?\" he said. Noriega found a way to attend the group stage of the Gold Cup and the knockout round of the Women\'s World Cup, but fellow American Outlaws member Ryan Shirah of Phoenix had to make a choice.\n\n\"For me, what it boils down to is cost,\" said Shirah, who is attending the U.S. men\'s domestic group stage games and the Gold Cup final in Chicago.\n\nGetting across the Atlantic at the height of the busy European summer travel season isn\'t cheap. According to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by ARC, flights to Paris from the U.S. for the knockout round, which begins June 22, are up 17.6% from 2018 to $1,374.22. Airfare through Paris for the duration of the tournament is slightly cheaper at $1,363.20, but still is up 12.3% from last year. That\'s to say nothing of the additional costs associated with traveling to and between the eight other host cities, either by plane, train or automobile.\n\nHotel prices vary widely among host cities, Kayak data show. The most expensive nightly rates are in Nice ($338) and Paris ($333) -- popular tourist destinations in their own right. Rooms in Montpelier are lower than previous years, but fans attending U.S.A. vs. Sweden or other games in Le Havre are less lucky: nightly rates have nearly doubled from last year to $187.\n\nIt\'s unclear if the option of staying home for the Gold Cup is dissuading U.S. soccer fans from traveling to France to support the defending champions. As of 30 days before the Women\'s World Cup opener on June 7, U.S. fans had purchased 123,191 tickets. For the same time frame, Concacaf said it expected \"to exceed half a million fans at the Gold Cup.\"\n\nThe concurrent schedules of the North and South American regionals with the Women\'s World Cup is a telling sign of the progress yet to be made, says Dan Wiersema, who runs communications and special projects for American Outlaws.\n\n\"This [the World Cup] is the pinnacle of sport, of soccer for women\'s national teams around the world,\" he said. \"They should have their own day.\"\n\nWrite to Laine Higgins at laine.higgins@wsj.com', '1166317898', 'https://images.wsj.net/im-83216/social', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'World Cup or Gold Cup?

The 1-0 loss to Brazil means the girls will not grow overconfident, the contentious nature of the decisive penalty means they should not get demoralised, and their final placement at the top of Group C means they will reap the highest advantage going into the last 16.\n\nAt this point, it seems legitimate to hope for a decent run from these former underdogs. The Azzurre held their own against everything the competition threw at them, and they were particularly impressive last night face to one of the tournament\'s original favourites, the Verdeoro of legendary striker Marta, aka the \'Pele in skirts\'.\n\nThe Brazilians played true to their cultural imprint, attacking relentlessly from the word \'go\', and with eye-catching brio to boot. The Italians, on the other hand, did not play like Italians at all: they were proactive in possession and equally-aggressive moving forward - a choice of strategy that was all the more surprising as they were already assured of qualification.\n\nThe result was 45 minutes of some of the most spectacular, sparkling football we\'ve seen at this World Cup, with end-to-end attacks that alternated the trickery of the South Americans (spearheaded by an inspired Marta) to the remarkable tactical geometries of the Europeans.\n\nDebinha\'s first-touch backheel shot could easily have turned into the goal of the tournament, had goalkeeper Laura Giuliani not pulled off a miraculous save. And yet Barbara Bonansea\'s flying scissor-kick minutes later was every bit as stunning, it too dying in the goalkeeper\'s arms.\n\nBonansea confirmed her status as Italy\'s best resource going forward. She is a smart, vibrant player, capable of attacking from all directions. That said, against Brazil the real stars were our midfielders. Aurora Galli and Manuela Giugliano were both excellent, but the one who impressed the most was Valentina Cernoia. A true asset to her XI, she was constantly shutting down passing lanes, keeping the Brazilian wingers on the leash and reorganising play in possession.\n\nThe frantic rhythm of those first 45 minutes could hardly be kept up, and so the game slowed down in the second half. As against Australia and Jamaica, the Azzurre now relied on the excellence of their defence to carry them unscathed to the end. That would have been a winning tactic too, had it not been for the unbelievably-generous penalty awarded to the Brazilians (and converted, inexorably, by Marta).\n\nThere is no point going over the referee\'s decision again, especially in light of the final standings in Group C. Instead, the real takeaway is how the Verdeoro needed that \'gift\' in the first place. Italy have now played against two of the strongest teams at this tournament, but they are yet to concede from open play, even though their tactics are anything but conservative. It seems the old spirit of Franco Baresi and Fabio Cannavaro has no trouble living on in the X chromosome.\n\nEven so, the Azzurre are much more than just a good team with an excellent defence. Their strength lies in their ductility: they seem to have solutions to almost all sorts of problems. They are just as efficient playing aggressively as they are reactively, they have specialists like \'the terminator\' Girelli and \'the brick-wall\' Sara Gama, combined with adaptive footballers like Bonansea and Galli, while all three of their starting midfielders can both attack and defend.\n\nCherry on the cake, these Azzurre seem to pull a new ace out of the sleeve with every game. We touched on Cernoia\'s revelation, but right-back Alia Guagni was equally phenomenal, providing bursts of speed down that right wing, which added a whole new dimension to the Italian offence.\n\nMy only reservations with regards to this team are related to their endurance. Coach Milena Bertolini\'s 4-3-3 puts very high demands on the midfield trio, and players like Cernoia, Giugliano, Bonansea and Girelli are getting little to no rest at all. I\'m not saying this is a critical weakness (yet), but we are only three games into an utterly gruelling tournament and already the Azzurre seem to be losing steam in the second halves of games.\n\nThis only worries me because competitors like the US and France are athletically so impressive. Their players are bigger and more powerful, and they seem much better equipped than the Italians to go a full 90 playing at full steam. When the physical difference is so marked, there is only so much that tactics and skill can do to compensate - and almost nothing if our players reach the game tired in the first place.\n\nThere will be time to find out if these concerns are well-founded. In any case, Bertolini\'s girls have shown remarkable tactical evolution in only three matches, having gone from repeatedly falling for the offside trap against the Australians to thinking their way out of Brazil\'s midfield mazes. If they do no more than playing like they know, the Azzurre should already have one foot in the quarter-finals. And it\'s incredible how good it feels to write that.', 'b-1166316088', 'https://www.football-italia.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/main_photo_rss_thumbnail/blog_images/italy-1906-brazil-epa.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Azzurre impress against Brazil', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', 'b-1166316088.php', 'The 1-0 loss to Brazil didn\'t compromise Italy\'s Women\'s World Cup campaign, writes Andrea Tallarita, as they keep getting better with each game.\n\nThi....', 0, 'null', 'null'),

In a Group D match on Wednesday, Scotland stole the show in the beginning as it registered a 3-0 lead against Argentina. However, Argentina stormed back and ended the match 3-3.\n\nThe first goal of the match was hit by Kim Alison Little of Scotland. Jen Beattie and Erin Cuthbert followed their teammate to score one goal each, from the corners.

The review ruled that Lee had came off her line by around six inches, thereby inviting a yellow card.\n\nBonsegundo then made the second attempt at the penalty and turned it into the decisive goal of the tournament, levelling the score 3-3.\n\nThe VAR was questioned during France vs Nigeria clash as well. While the game went on to 0-0, it was in penalty shootout that the VAR ruled that Nigerian goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie was off her goal line.

In the four days the Americans have been on the Normandy coast, there has been rain, hail, thunder, lightning and heavy leaden clouds.\n\nVery little shine.\n\nScattered rain is again in the forecast for Thursday, although it is expected to stop a couple of hours before the U.S. takes the field to face Sweden in the final group-play match of the tournament. And while that could leave the pitch wet and slick, U.S. coach Jill Ellis said Wednesday that would be a good thing.\n\n\"We always water the pitch,\" she said. \"It actually helps when you want to play fast if there\'s a little rain. (But) it doesn\'t matter, rain or shine. The conditions, they are what they are.\n\n\"We\'re used to playing on fast surfaces.

So that got some of the players to thinking: Who would win if the U.S. faced the U.S. in the final next month?\n\n\"Our trainings are so competitive we literally feel like we could enter a second team into this World Cup and they\'d do quite well,\" defender Crystal Dunn said. \"That\'s just a testament of how hungry we are to be starters. Not being a starter on our team doesn\'t mean you\'re actually not a good player. It just means that\'s how competitive our roster is.\n\n\"We think we have literally 23 people who could start and play in this World Cup if they were on national teams.\"\n\nIn some ways, Dunn said, the U.S. doesn\'t have a first team and a second team -- just a team.\n\n\"We trust everybody on the pitch,\" she said. \"We trust everybody that we brought to this World Cup. We can be dangerous. And it\'s not just the starting 11.\"\n\nCAST OF ... WELL, DOZENS\n\nThe U.S. roster is only 23 names long, but the support staff the Americans brought to the World Cup is much bigger with a team of 33 people, ranging from coaches and analysts to trainers, massage therapists and equipment handlers, most of whom work quietly behind the scenes to meet players\' needs.\n\n\"We\'ve got so many people,\" said forward Carli Lloyd, who has seen that staff grow over the four Women\'s World Cup tournaments in which she has played. \"Everyone kind of chips in and is helping this team in any way possible. And it couldn\'t be done without all of those people.\"\n\nEvery team in France has a support staff, although the size of that staff is often limited by the financial resources of a country\'s national soccer federation.

The top-ranked Americans have the better goal difference and with a win or draw would play Spain in the round of 16 and could face No. 4 France in a quarterfinal at Paris\' Parc des Princes and No. 3 England in the semifinals.\n\nThe team that finishes second in the group meets the Netherlands or Canada in the round of 16, then could have a quarterfinal against No. 2 Germany, which would not have the backing of a large home crowd the way host nation France does every match.\n\nU.S. coach Jill Ellis says she can\'t convince her players not to tackle in practice, so asking them to hold back against Sweden is a losing cause. Ellis thinks it is dangerous to try to tailor results based on possible matchups.\n\n\"We want to win every game, so I think that\'s where we\'re at and that\'s what we want to do,\" Ellis said. \"I think if you get too much into manipulating or planning or overthinking something, I just don\'t think that that\'s a good message.\"\n\nThe United States has played Sweden six times in the group stage at the World Cup, including a 0-0 draw four years ago in Canada.\n\nThey met again in the quarterfinals at the 2016 Olympics, where the Swedes -- led by former U.S. coach Pia Sundhage -- bunkered in on defense and advanced on penalty kicks after a 1-1 draw. It was the earliest exit for the Americans at an Olympics. U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo infamously called the Swedes \"cowards.\"\n\nThe only meeting since then was a 1-0 U.S. win in a 2017 friendly at Goteborg.\n\nAfter the U.S. opened with a record-setting 13-0 rout of Thailand, Ellis changed seven starters in a 3-0 win over Chile.\n\n\"If you want to go far in the tournament, you\'ve got to have (fresh) legs,\" Ellis said, explaining her rotation.\n\nNo. 9 Sweden started with a 2-0 victory over Chile and followed with a 5-1 win over Thailand.\n\n\"It\'s going to be a completely different match, and it will be very important for us, naturally,\" Sweden coach Peter Gerhardsson said. \"When you go into the second round we\'ll have more matches against teams like the U.S. rather than matches against the one with Chile. But we have to win the matches to get through it, it\'s all about how games develop and how players perform but it will be a different match and we will approach it differently tactically.\"\n\nNo. 13 Spain made its World Cup debut four years ago and was eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\"They\'re both talented,\" La Rioja defender Celia Jiménez said. \"I think any team that qualifies for the World Cup, it\'s because they\'re good enough. The U.S. has a really powerful team, they play a direct game, they like to be dangerous, but at the same time I think Sweden is as well a really good team.

We do like to play with a certain style, and I think in the second half, because we were so open and just a little bit fatigued, we probably got exposed a little bit.\n\n\"We\'ve got another clean sheet, we\'ve won another game, we\'ve played three and won three and we are just where we want to be - in the last 16, ready to attack the business end of tournament.\"\n\nNeville\'s side, who previously beat Scotland 2-1 and Argentina 1-0, will now face a third-placed finisher in the next round - either China (Group B), or Cameroon or New Zealand (Group E), or Chile or Thailand (Group F).\n\nThat will be determined on Thursday when Groups E and F conclude, and the match will take place on Sunday in Valenciennes.\n\nAfter stressing in the build-up to the Japan match that he wanted to win it and would pick his \"best team\" to achieve that, Neville made eight changes to his starting XI.\n\nNeville, who had made four changes for the match before, said when asked what he might do for the last 16: \"It depends on what team we are we playing.\n\n\"I said yesterday we\'d pick our best team today, our strongest team, and the team we picked was the strongest team to play against Japan.\n\n\"We need to decide which team we are playing, then decide how they play, how we are going to beat them, and then the players that are going to fit best, and I think that is what rotation is about.\n\n\"It\'s not about throwing 23 players into a hat and pulling out 11, we strategically plan each rotation.\"\n\nForward White, midfielder Stanway and goalkeeper Karen Bardsley, who superbly tipped a Kumi Yokoyama free-kick on to the bar in the ninth minute, were among those brought into the team.\n\nNeville said he thought Bardsley, 34, was in the world\'s top three goalkeepers, and said of 20-year-old Stanway: \"If she keeps her feet on the ground, keeps progressing, working hard, and listening to the coaches, she is going to be one of the best players in world football - she has that potential.\"\n\nWhite, who joined Bardsley and Stanway at Manchester City just prior to the World Cup, had scored in the opener against Scotland before being demoted to the bench against Argentina.\n\nShe said: \"I was pretty angry about that one.\n\n\"Obviously I\'m delighted to have got two starts.

A one-goal winning margin could prove enough for them to make it through as one of the best third-placed sides but progression would be guaranteed with a two-goal victory.\n\nThe various permutations have been worked through breathlessly by many onlookers over the last few days but Football Ferns coach Tom Sermanni hasn\'t been among those getting their calculators out.\n\n\"Everything else is out of our control and I would get mixed up with all that anyway,\" he laughs.\n\n\"There\'s no point in looking around at who is playing who and all that kind of stuff. It\'s just a case of us focusing on getting a result against Cameroon.\"\n\nAfter being kept scoreless in their two previous matches, the first task for the Ferns is to find the net and midfielder Olivia Chance says composure will be key in doing so.\n\n\"You need to score goals to win anyway so nothing changes really,\" she says.\n\n\"I think it\'s just about keeping to the game plan and being comfortable. The goals will come as long as we keep the ball and make chances.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old could have an important role to play in that as she has come as close as anyone to breaking New Zealand\'s duck at this tournament. Early on in the opening match against the Netherlands, Chance hit a near pin-point shot onto the underside of the cross bar, only to watch it somehow bounce away from goal.\n\nThat was one of several opportunities carved out by the Ferns in an impressive performance but sights of goal were much harder to come by in a follow-up loss to Canada. There was widespread disappointment among the players that they weren\'t able to back up their opening display with another strong showing and Chance is looking forward to bouncing back.\n\n\"It\'s really good having another game after that performance because there\'s so much we want to make right,\" she admits.\n\n\"And I think that\'s going to push us to get over the line. We\'ve got 90 minutes left at this World Cup if we don\'t pull through and there\'s no better pressure than that.\"\n\nCameroon likewise have everything to play for though as they have a similar record to New Zealand and can keep their own hopes of progressing alive with a win. Getting the better of the central Africans will be far from straightforward as they have proved a tough nut to crack in their previous pool games and, unlike New Zealand, have a goal to their name after scoring in a 3-1 defeat to the Netherlands.\n\n\"We\'re expecting a very tough game, they\'ve been very competitive against both the Netherlands and Canada,\" Sermanni says.\n\n\"They\'re physically strong, well-organised defensively and have pace up front so it will be another very difficult challenge for us.\"\n\nLike his players, Sermanni felt the Ferns were far from their best against Canada and is expecting a positive response to the do-or-die nature of tomorrow\'s assignment.\n\n\"The Canada game was one where we were outplayed on the day, which happens in sport. But, other than that, I can\'t fault the focus and effort from the team,\" he says.\n\n\"I think everybody is back on track and the players and staff all know how important this game is.

But that doesn\'t mean there\'s nothing to play for -- or not to play for, depending upon how such matters are viewed.\n\nWith a win or draw, the U.S. wins the group and moves into the top half of the tournament bracket with England, France and Australia, who are all ranked among the top six in the world.\n\nLose and it drops in the bottom half with Italy, Japan and Germany, just one of which is ranked higher than seventh, clearing a far easier path to the semifinals.\n\nThis might be a case in which a loss is actually a win, right? Well, not in the Americans\' camp.\n\n\"It\'s in our team\'s DNA to want to win and do really well,\" defender Abby Dahlkemper said. \"Entering this tournament it\'s just been 110% focused on the next game. We have Sweden and we want to progress and keep getting better.\"\n\nHer coach agreed.\n\n\"We want to win every game. That\'s where we\'re at and that\'s what we want to do,\" said Jill Ellis, who has never lost a World Cup match as manager. \"Deciding to come second or manipulate a score, that can be dangerous. The draw is what it is and we navigate whoever is in front of us.\"\n\nFinishing first would send the U.S. to a round-of-16 meeting with Spain on Monday in Reims. A win there could bring a quarterfinal matchup in Paris with France, the only team to beat the U.S. in the last 23 months. A loss to Sweden would send the U.S. to meet either Canada or the Netherlands, followed by a likely quarterfinal clash with Germany, which hasn\'t beaten the U.S. in 16 years.\n\nEllis waved away such speculation.\n\n\"Right now the only team that we\'re concerned about is the team that\'s right in front of us. And that\'s Sweden,\" she said.\n\nThe game is arguably the team\'s most important of the group stage. The U.S. cruised to wins over Thailand and Chile, outscoring them 16-0 while clearing its bench and using all 20 outfield players. Sweden will offer a far sterner challenge, exactly what the Americans need before beginning the unforgiving elimination stage.\n\n\"Coming out of the group stage you want to build momentum,\" Ellis said. \"We know we\'re through to the next round but we really want to sort of fine-tune things that we feel. It\'s going to a give our players a good test against a good side.\"\n\nSweden has long been a thorn in the U.S.\' side. Only China and Norway have beaten the Americans more often than Sweden, the only team to defeat the U.S. in 23 World Cup group-stage matches dating to 1991. And the Swedes have lost just one of their last five meetings with the U.S., among them a quarterfinal in the last Olympics where Sweden handed the Americans their earliest elimination from a major tournament.\n\nSign up for our weekly soccer newsletter \"\n\nMany on the U.S. still consider that game a turning point in the team\'s development. After winning the 2015 World Cup, the team Ellis took to Brazil was one in transition. So when Sweden bunkered in and played for penalty kicks, the U.S. was lost for a response.\n\n\"For me, it was an awareness of saying, \'Hey, we\'ve got to be able to break teams down in multiple ways,\'\" Ellis said. \"It can\'t just be a ball in behind. It can\'t just be a set piece. It has to be different ways to break teams down.\"\n\nSo Ellis broadened the U.S. attack and changed formations. Her team builds out of the back now, plays wide and pushes down the wings, giving it the ability to strike from all over the field.\n\n\"Where the team was then and where we are now is night and day,\" defender Crystal Dunn said. \"It\'s been three years since then. I don\'t even think about that game. We\'re just in a completely different place as a team right now.\"\n\nForward Christen Press, who skied her penalty try well over the crossbar to give Sweden the win in Brazil, said that game marked a personal turning point as well.\n\n\"Despite the fact it\'s been three years, you don\'t forget the taste in your mouth when you fail,\" she said Wednesday. \"There is a little bit of that that will definitely act as motivation. You never want to have that feeling again.\"\n\nWhere the U.S. hasn\'t been challenged in this World Cup is on defense, with goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher facing just three shots. Sweden, which has seven goals in the tournament (trailing only the U.S. and Australia) is certain to test her.\n\nBut Dunn said her teammates won\'t make it easy.\n\n\"For us to throw a game and not want to win right before a knockout round,\" she said \"is crazy.\"\n\nkevin.baxter@latimes.com | Twitter: @kbaxter11', '1166885340', 'https://www.trbimg.com/img-5d0add71/turbine/la-sp-jill-ellis-usa-sweden-world-cup-trek-20190619', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'U.S. doesn\'t care if a win over Sweden makes their World Cup trek tougher', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1166885340.php', 'The U.S. is on to the knockout stage of the Women\'s World Cup no matter what happens in its final group-stage match Thursday in this port city on the ....', 0, 'null', 'null'),

After a 1-1 draw, Sweden prevailed on penalties and handed the United States its earliest exit in the tournament.\n\n\"I don\'t know what the U.S. feels for this game, but It\'s the first time since the Olympics that we meet in this kind of setting, so I think they do want to put us in our place,\" said goalkeeper Hedvig Lindvahl. \"That\'s my feeling.

Ninth-ranked Sweden opened with a 2-0 victory over Chile and followed with a 5-1 win over Thailand.\n\nThe top-ranked Americans have the better goal difference and with a win or draw they would play Spain in the round of 16.

We\'re not focused on past results,\" said defender Crystal Dunn.\n\nIt is the sixth time that the United States and Sweden have met in the group stage, with the United States holding a 3-1-1 advantage. The two teams have met once since the Olympics, a friendly in 2017 that the U.S. won 1-0 in Goteborg.\n\nThe game between the United States and ninth-ranked Sweden is one of four games that wrap up the group stage Thursday. Also in Group F, Chile and Thailand play in Rennes. Both teams are winless but have a chance to reach the next round as a third-place finisher.\n\nThe only third place teams that had wrapped up spots in the round of 16 were China and Brazil.\n\nAlready though to the knockout stage, both teams are even with two wins and the same goal differential. But the Dutch have one more goal for the tiebreaker if it comes to that.\n\nWhichever team finishes atop Group E will head to Rennes to face Group D runner-up Japan, while second place goes to Paris to play either Sweden or the United States.\n\n\"Doing math is so dangerous,\" Netherlands coach Sarina Wiegman said. \"We just want to win and play good football.\"\n\nCameroon and New Zealand, both winless in Group E, wrap up in Montpellier with a chance at a spot in the next round.\n\nRECAPPING WEDNESDAY: Florencia Bonsegundo converted a penalty kick in the fourth minute of second-half stoppage time on her second attempt as Argentina overcame a three-goal deficit in the final 30 minutes for a 3-3 draw against Scotland.

Argentina would advance if both the Cameroon-New Zealand and Thailand-Chile matches on Thursday finish in draws. Argentina was eliminated in the group stage of its first two World Cup appearances. ... England remained undefeated and clinched the top spot in its group with a 2-0 victory over Japan. Ellen White scored both goals against Japan and has three so far at the tournament. It was the first time since 1982 that an England team, men or women, won all three group stage games.

Cameroon players were seething again when they were denied a goal at the start of the second half when another off-side VAR review went against the lowest-ranked team remaining in the competition.\n\nAn unusual opening goal set the tone for a game of remarkable moments at Stade du Hainaut. When White crossed from the left flank to Toni Duggan, Augustine Ejangue intercepted and passed back to her goalkeeper, Annette Ngo Ndom.\n\nThe indirect free kick was awarded, sparking anger among Cameroon players. Ejangue was caught on camera spitting toward Duggan but she faced no repercussions, even with VAR available to review the incident which could have resulted in a red card.\n\nThat ugly affair came after a crude elbow to the jaw of an England player earlier in the first half that could also have resulted in a send-off.\n\nAfter the match, England coach Phil Neville said he was \"completely and utterly ashamed\" of Cameroon\'s behaviour.\n\n\"I sat through 90 minutes of football and felt ashamed. I was proud of performances, under circumstances I\'ve never seen before,\" Neville said.\n\n\"I\'m completely and utterly ashamed of the opposition.\n\n\"I didn\'t enjoy the game. My players didn\'t enjoy the game, apart from getting to the quarter-finals\n\n\"I\'m afraid today we saw, I thought, a behaviour that\'s unacceptable on a football field.\n\n\"It didn\'t feel like football. That wasn\'t football, in terms of the behaviour I want to see from footballers.\n\n\"This goes out worldwide. That\'s not what we want young girls to watch.\"\n\nDuring first-half stoppage time, right back Lucy Bronze cut into a central position and slipped the ball through to White, who put the ball in the net. The flag went up for off-side, but the celebrations were only delayed. White was given her fourth goal in three matches at this tournament.\n\nWhen stadium big screens showed the off-side decision, Cameroon players were pointing up, apparently bemused by the call to allow the goal. As Cameroon\'s players remained in a huddle protesting, the referee delayed the restart. The game eventually resumed, briefly, before halftime.\n\nAs the England players headed down the tunnel, their opponents remained on the field to complain to the officials and then to huddle together.\n\nThe anger lingered into the second half.\n\nCameroon thought it had scored inside four minutes of the restart when Ajara Nchout put the ball in the net. Again, celebrations began before she was stopped in her tracks for a VAR review.\n\nGabrielle Onguene was determined to be in an off-side position when Nchout received the ball. Denied a goal, Nchout held her head in her hands and cried. The playmaker had to be comforted by manager Alain Djeumfa. A\n\ngain, the Cameroonians looked like they didn\'t want to resume playing. England scored a third time in the 58th minute.\n\nA low corner was sent by Dugan to the onrushing Greenwood, who was left unmarked to sweep the ball into the net minutes after her sloppy back pass nearly gave Cameroon a goal.', '1170777636', 'https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2019/06/24/v3imagesbin2bdf89eeacee053ab712bfceab6b2b8a-xtd1db5md6tbz35vis2_ct300x300.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', '\'Gross\' act leaves coach spitting mad', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1170777636.php', 'ENGLAND recorded a 3-0 victory over Cameroon on Monday morning (AEST), clinching a place in the Women\'s World Cup quarter-finals after a game punctuat....', 1, 'women\'s world cup', 'scotland var'),

(401, '2019-06-24 01:19:30', 'pressherald.com', 'Sports', 'Maine\'s styrofoam ban met with mixed response from Waterville-area businesses - Portland Press Herald', 'WATERVILLE -- Maine recently made headlines as the first state in the country to place a ban on Styrofoam food containers.\n\nWhile the news has been met with positivity from groups advocating for the end of single-use plastics and non-recyclables, a handful of small business owners have voiced mixed feelings about the economic repercussions on their restaurants. Nowhere in Maine is this contrast stronger than the Waterville area, where savings-oriented mom and pop shops neighbor one of the world\'s largest paper food packaging manufacturers, Huhtamaki.\n\nCome Jan. 1, 2021, the use of polystyrene -- more commonly known by the trade name Styrofoam -- will be prohibited from convenience stores, grocery stores, restaurants, food trucks, farm stands and coffee shops. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Janet Mills on April 30 after passing in the House and Senate. Hospitals, seafood shippers and stores that sell pre-packaged meat are exempt from the rule.\n\nAt the University of Maine, researchers are already anticipating the next steps, with hope for the state\'s pulp and paper industry. The state government has kept the momentum going, with Mills enacting a ban on plastic bags Monday.\n\nThe ban on styrofoam package trays, which are used in the kitchen at the Palmyra Country Store, has owners Gary and Betty Lincoln concerned about the financial impact it will have on their business. Morning Sentinel photo by David Leaming\n\nLOCAL IMPACT\n\nTo some, the polystyrene ban is just the latest piece of legislation that \"is not making Maine a very business-friendly state,\" as Gary Lincoln put it.\n\n\"As a small business, you\'ve gotta watch every penny of every dollar to make ends meet,\" said Lincoln, who co-owns the Palmyra Country Store with his wife, Betty. \"With the increase in minimum wage, rising food costs and now this -- it\'s a losing battle to keep the line of profit.\"\n\nLincoln said he buys about two cases, or 400 individual Styrofoam containers, a month. The store sells anything from pizza and hot subs to chicken nuggets, breakfast sandwiches and fried pickles -- \"hot, doughy-type things,\" as Lincoln described them. He said paper containers cost at least 55 cents a piece more than the polystyrene alternatives, which he buys for 25 cents each.\n\n\"You\'re talking cents per container when you look from Styrofoam to paper,\" Lincoln said. \"But still, ... it adds up. If you go from 25 to 80 cents a piece, you\'re already looking at tripling it or more ... from $100 a month (to $320). To make ends meet, you\'d have to pass that price on and increase menu prices, which doesn\'t make your customers happy ... You feel bad, but you can\'t operate at a loss.\"\n\nLincoln said that had he and Betty known this law was in the pipeline, they might not have chosen to buy and open the country store last June. The pair has managed the Waterville branch of Governor\'s Restaurant & Bakery -- which also uses foam clam shells -- for the past 24 years. With exposure to the industry, they were able to predict and plan for increases in food costs and Maine\'s minimum wage, but the Styrofoam ban \"was a shock.\"\n\n\"We heard rumors, and I just kept thinking, \'Oh, it didn\'t pass,\'\" Lincoln noted. \"But then it passed. ... It does make you nervous. If we didn\'t manage Governor\'s, it would be much more stressful. We couldn\'t live off what the store makes. ... But at this point, we\'re still doing fine.\"\n\nBetty and Gary Lincoln, owners of the Palmyra Country Store, are concerned about the financial impact the ban on styrofoam package products they use in the store will have on their business. Morning Sentinel photo by David Leaming\n\nIn the next year and a half, the Lincolns will hunt for the \"cheapest possible alternative\" and hope that demand for paper products doesn\'t \"jack up\" prices.\n\nStavros Kosmidis, owner of Waterville House of Pizza, said he will likely hold off on the transition until the last minute. The pizza shop uses polystyrene takeout containers for everything on its menu, including the cups for soft drinks.\n\n\"It\'s not gonna be convenient for us, let\'s put it that way,\" he said. \"You cannot do with paper what you can do with plastic.\"\n\nKosmidis said he understands the environmental benefits of moving away from Styrofoam but that the anticipated expenses are not ideal. He also said he was worried that paper-based alternatives will not be as sturdy as foam.\n\n\"I know it\'s a good idea to ban the plastic containers, but in the meantime it\'s gonna hurt us. But we\'ve gotta do what we\'ve gotta do,\" Kosmidis said. \"If that\'s gonna cost us extra money, then, like everything else, we\'ll pass it to the customer. I\'m a customer myself, and we\'re gonna end up paying more money for the things we need. So it comes down to the people -- they\'ve gotta pay for it.\"\n\n\"That\'s what everybody\'s gonna do,\" said Kate Goodwin, owner of Belanger\'s Drive-In in Fairfield, about increasing menu prices to cover more pricey packaging. Goodwin voiced indifference over the new state policy. Most of the foods at Belanger\'s are already served in paper packaging, she said. It\'s just the burgers, steak bombs and a few other sandwiches that will need new vessels.\n\n\"We may switch over next year, but we have not even really discussed it yet,\" she said. \"I know we\'ll be able to replace everything that\'s Styrofoam, I just don\'t know what the cost is going to be.\"\n\nThe North Street Dairy Cone switched from foam to paper cups and dishes this year, according to Melissa Paradis, whose parents own the store. Despite leading to \"the first time in -- I think -- four years since we raised prices,\" she said the transition hasn\'t been detrimental to the family business in Waterville.\n\nNorth Street Dairy Cone owner Rachel Paradis uses paper products for ice cream orders at her business in Waterville on Thursday. Paradis\' daughter Melissa said that most customers have been happy that the family business switched to paper despite a rise in prices. Morning Sentinel photo by David Leaming\n\n\"By the end of July, we probably won\'t have any Styrofoam left,\" she said.\n\nParadis said she and her parents, John and Rachel, saw the polystyrene ban coming, and most customers have been happy about their business\'s response.\n\n\"We have a lot of Colby College students, and they tend to be very environmentally aware. So they\'ve asked for quite some time for us to make the transition to paper,\" she said. \"Some would even bring their own containers rather than get ice cream in Styrofoam.\"\n\nWhile the law could be a step in the right direction for Maine, she said, recycling still matters.\n\n\"I think it\'s a good thing for the environment, but that is only if we\'re recycling the paper because it creates the same amount of waste. (Except,) I know paper breaks down better,\" Paradis said.\n\nMichael Higgins stands in front of Huhtamaki in Fairfield on Saturday. Morning Sentinel photo by Michael G. Seamans\n\n\'FAVORABLE\' FOR HUHTAMAKI\n\nAt the Waterville Huhtamaki plant, the polystyrene ban could translate into more jobs, though officials say it\'s too early to determine any actual effect.\n\nThe facility stopped producing fiber-based clam shell takeout containers several years ago, according to Michael Higgins, who represents 450 Huhtamaki employees in the United Steelworkers trade union and was a former employee there himself. But one of the \"biggest sellers\" made in Waterville today are fiber-based, compostable school lunch trays. Production increased on the heels of a national movement to replace foam lunch trays at schools, Higgins said.\n\nWess Hudelson, a communications manager for Huhtamaki, did not respond to questions about whether the Finland-based company has plans to expand its product line and output or start making hinged containers in Maine again. There are 10 different molded fiber clam shells listed on the company\'s online catalog.\n\nAn employee heads home after working a shift at Huhtamaki on the Fairfield and Waterville border line in 2015. A union representative said it\'s tough to predict how the foam ban will affect the business but did say it had provided a sense of job security among employees. Morning Sentinel file photo\n\n\"Right now, they\'re not in a place to make any changes,\" Higgins said. \"It all depends on sales. If the need comes up, certainly Huhtamaki in Waterville could make any (kind of fiber-based takeout container). Molded fiber can be turned into pretty much anything.\n\n\"It\'s tough to tell how this will impact the business,\" Higgins added.\n\nThe foam ban has provided a sense of job security for existing employees, though, he said.\n\n\"I think there\'s some security in the new law,\" Higgins said. \"What that actually means for Waterville itself remains to be seen, but we have a very good workforce there, a good management team, and I think whatever needs to be developed to help out the restaurants or vendors will be accomplished.\n\n\"I think that this is something that could develop into more work for us; it\'s just I can\'t tell you with 100% certainty ... But certainly it\'s not gonna hurt.\"\n\nHudelson echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"While we don\'t anticipate that the recent legislation in Maine will have significant impact on our business, we see the continued trend to renewable, fiber-based, compostable products as favorable for the facility in Waterville,\" Hudelson wrote in an email to the Morning Sentinel.\n\nThe plant, located on College Avenue, employs about 520 people, Hudelson said.\n\nLOOKING FORWARD\n\nUniversity of Maine professor Douglas Bousfield. Photo courtesy of Douglas Bousfield\n\nUniversity of Maine professor Douglas Bousfield said that where the polystyrene ban could benefit Mainers the most is closer to the raw materials side of the supply chain.

But before you make your 2019 Women\'s World Cup predictions for the Round of 16, be sure to see the USA vs. Spain picks from David Sumpter\'s Soccerbot model.\n\nSumpter is an applied mathematician and author of \"Soccermatics,\" a book that explains how math works inside the sport. Along with other experienced analysts, Sumpter developed the powerful Soccerbot model.\n\nThe Soccerbot reads current odds and all team performance data, calculates key metrics and predicts upcoming matches. In the three seasons since its inception, Soccerbot is up an incredible 2,000 percent on Premier League picks. That\'s right -- 2,000 percent.\n\nThe model crushed its 2019 Women\'s World Cup group stage picks, returning a healthy profit to anyone following it. The model correctly predicted the stunning Japan-Argentina draw (+825) -- a more than 8-1 long shot -- and was all over USA beating Sweden, Germany outlasting Spain, England topping Scotland and Australia\'s dramatic comeback win over Brazil.\n\nNow, the model has its sights set on USA vs. Spain in the 2019 World Cup. We can tell you it\'s leaning under, but its much stronger play is on the money line, saying one side has all the value. You can see that selection exclusively at SportsLine.\n\nThe model knows that the Americans will be leaning heavily on a defense that hasn\'t allowed a goal in 594 minutes to help keep Hermoso quiet and quell any worries of Spanish upset. Team USA not only has held its opponents scoreless thus far, but the Americans have allowed few scoring chances. The Americans recorded a historic 13-0 win over Thailand in the opener, then defeated Sweden 2-0 and Chile 3-0.\n\nThe United States has also been relentless on offense, with 82 shot attempts leading to 33 shots on goal. Eighteen of those shots, or 22 percent, have found the back of the net. Whether it\'s Alex Morgan or Carli Lloyd leading the attack, or a combination of the two, few teams have an answer for the USWNT in the final third.\n\nBut just because the Americans have crushed the competition doesn\'t mean they\'re the best value on the USA vs. Spain money line.\n\nThis is Spain\'s second-ever Women\'s World Cup appearance, on the heels of a 2015 berth. But Spain crushed its competition to qualify for the Women\'s World Cup, going 8-0 and outscoring its opponents 25-2. It held its own in a 1-0 defeat to the USA in January, and arguably outplayed Germany in a 1-0 loss in the group stage, outshooting the Germans while controlling possession 59 percent of the time. The Spaniards will also be more rested, with seven days between games compared to just four for the Americans.\n\nSpain is better known for its defense than its offense, but forward Jennifer Hermoso is considered one of the top playmakers at the Women\'s World Cup 2019. She has 39 goals in 71 international matches, including seven in World Cup qualifying, and she found the back of the net in her team\'s 3-1 win over South Africa in group play.\n\nSo who wins USA vs. Spain?

Unlike many popular channels out there, this show is a dedicated non echo-chamber, where all views are all going to be considered without discrimination. I hope you subscribe if you are interested.\n\nToday, I\'m going to talk about the escalating tensions between America and Iran, which I am seriously getting worried about. You see, war is the ultimate enemy of freedom. It wastes a lot of money, makes everyone less safe, provides the conditions for a heightened surveillance state, and so on. The libertarian case against almost every war since 1946 is well documented. I still remember how George W. Bush got America and her allies into the 2003 Iraq War, which almost everyone knows was a mistake by now. And, from what I can see, where we are at right now looks eerily similar to where we were in the second half of 2002, less than a year from the Iraq War. I fear that if we don\'t wake up and force a change of course soon enough, history will repeat itself again.\n\nHowever, we also have some things we didn\'t have in 2002. For example, the internet has brought together many people who are dedicated in their opposition to war. There\'s also the fact that the Iraq War is still so recent. Back in 2002, the last widely rejected war, the Vietnam War, was 30 years ago, and only those middle-aged or older would have memories of it. Many young people were thus late to mobilize on that issue. By the time mass protests were held in early 2003, President Bush was well on his way to starting the war. But today, a whole generation of us have grown up watching the Iraq tragedy unfold, and are committed to preventing another one from happening.\n\nFinally, we have an anti-war leader right now, in the form of Tulsi Gabbard, who has a pretty high profile because she is also running for president. We certainly didn\'t have that in 2002. Having a leadership figure who can talk to the media and spread the anti-war message is important, and to her credit Tulsi is tirelessly spreading her message everywhere these days, even begging President Trump to change course on Iran.\n\nThe trouble is, much of the media is trying their best to ignore Tulsi Gabbard and her message, as they continue to drum up the case for war. Many of us can smell the unfairness of this in the air, and we are getting angrier by the day. I guess what we can do is to help spread the message, Tulsi\'s message, as well as other anti-war people\'s messages, via the internet, via social media. Unlike in 2002, we have a leader, we have a movement, we have passionate people, and we have the internet. There\'s still a good chance we can stop a potential US-Iran war, if we work together. I also think we should make the most of every opportunity to get the anti-war message heard. For example, there will be a 2020 Democratic candidates\' debate during the next week, and Tulsi will speak in the first round on the 26th of June. She will definitely have lots to say about the endless, needless wars. I think it will be a good opportunity for us to help spread the anti-war message. We can help Tulsi\'s message go even further.\n\nAnother thing we can do is to talk about the consequences of the 2003 Iraq War. Even though the Bush administration claimed victory very soon, the defence forces of the US and her allies were tied up in Iraq for many years to come, costing taxpayers lots of money. The prolonged involvement also meant increasing lives lost over the years. Order wasn\'t able to be restored in many places, providing fertile ground for terrorist groups to recruit and operate, which in turn led to the world being a much more dangerous place years later. In short, the 2003 Iraq War was the worst decision a president ever made since the Vietnam War, which was, of course, another different tragedy altogether.\n\nThat\'s all for today.

There is no need for another conflict in the Middle East - which would cost the lives of both civilians and military members - over the destruction of a drone ($130M price tag or otherwise).\n\nThe next steps for the administration will be quite interesting as it appears there may be a fracture within the ranks on foreign policy. Trump\'s inner circle is set up almost as a team of rivals - to steal a line from Doris Kearns Goodwin - with a variety of opinions. The hawks enjoy powerful positions with John Bolton as National Security Adviser and Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State. The more cautious parts include Marine General Joe Dunford, who chairs the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Fox News host Tucker Carlson also weighed in on Iran during a talk with Trump.\n\nTrump appears to vacillate from one side to the other depending on the issue. He called off last week\'s strike but had previously approved attacks in Syria. The president has also approved a troop buildup in the Middle East with over 20K military members in the region and a thousand more headed there - per The Wall Street Journal. We\'re still involved in the Yemen civil war with Green Berets helping out Saudi troops. Trump will hold summits and praise North Korea but won\'t talk with Venezuela.\n\nRestraint should win the day as there is no reason to go to war with Iran. The country is not a threat to the United States - despite their \"Death to America\" chants in Parliament.\n\nThere also needs to be more consistency with Iran. Trump pulled out of the Iran agreement by using the excuse it wasn\'t approved by the Senate. He should have asked the Senate to vote on the agreement because it is a treaty, as required by the Constitution. Now he has Pompeo pushing for talks while doing a slapdash of sanctions in hopes of isolating Iran further.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush once admitted sanctions weren\'t working.\n\n\"We\'re relying upon others, because we\'ve sanctioned ourselves out of influence with Iran,\" he told the press in 2004. \"We don\'t have much leverage with the Iranians right now, and we expect them to listen to those voices, and we\'re a part of the universal acclaim.\"\n\nThe U.S. didn\'t change its policy during Bush\'s tenure, however, and former President Barack Obama kept major sanctions on Iran in place following the nuclear deal (which really should have gone through the Senate).\n\nIt should be pointed out the Iranian regime has figured out ways to get around the sanctions. Via National Interest in 2013:\n\nIran\'s negative economic trajectory has led it to adopt a so-called \"economy of resistance.\" Over the short to medium term, this has taken shape in several ways, including maintaining a positive balance of trade through import controls and a positive balance of payments through utilizing domestic financial resources in funding projects; relying on foreign-exchange reserves; reducing the state budget\'s reliance on oil revenue while boosting revenues from taxes and privatization; and increasing domestic refining capacity in order to use excess crude at home while shifting domestic energy consumption to free up gas for exports. At the same time, trade patterns have been forced to move away from official banking to unofficial financial networks, and merchants have been compelled to resort to barter trade.\n\nThe National Iranian American Council wrote in 2013 they believed the sanctions were enabling Iranian leaders to stay in power.\n\nSupreme Leader Khamenei has remained steadfast in his approach to sanctions. The escalating sanctions regime has enabled him to strengthen a powerful pre-existing narrative that portrays Western powers as a brutal, immoral group of governments out to \"get\" Iran, and that their core interest is to keep Iran underdeveloped and dependent. This narrative serves to maintain unity in a fragmented power structure, through:\n\n*Sustenance of the image of an unrelenting enemy.\n\n*Justification of the need for a feared security apparatus as a means to counter that enemy.\n\n*Mobilizing the support of a minority segment of society who can be paraded as \"popular support\" when needed - on the anniversary of the revolution, during elections, etc.\n\nThe President\'s avoidance of military action against Iran is a good thing and one he should continue to keep in place. However, Trump is wrong to not end the current policy of sanctions upon sanctions. Diplomatic engagement and talk will do more to strengthen ties between America and Iran and encourage freedom in both through free trade and free markets.\n\nThe role of Congress should not be ignored in this. The Senate needs to vote on whatever plan is made: whether it\'s airstrikes or a new agreement with the Iranians. The Constitution demands it, and if Obama was wrong for bypassing the Senate on the Iran Deal (and he was) then Trump should not go around them to enact whatever policy he\'s planning. His decision to show restraint on Iran is laudable, but he should show more when it comes to sanctions.', '1170734414', 'https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/t-8.jpg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'Trump was right to not bomb Iran', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1170734414.php', 'President Donald Trump\'s decision to avoid an unnecessary war with Iran deserves plenty of praise.

(413, '2019-06-24 08:30:53', 'sportstalkflorida.com', 'Sports', 'USA faces Spain in the Knockout round of the Women\'s World Cup noon today. - Sports Talk Florida - N', 'REIMS, France (AP) -- Much of the attention on the United States rightly goes to its prolific offense, especially after that 13-goal game to open the Women\'s World Cup, but the team\'s defense has been predictably reliable so far in France.\n\nThe defense has posted shutouts in the team\'s first three games, marking the first time the United States has not conceded a goal in the group stage at the tournament. The defending champions open the knockout round Monday against Spain.\n\nGoalkeeper Alyssa Naeher saw little action during the team\'s rout of Thailand in the opener, but matches against Chile and Sweden provided incrementally tougher tests.\n\n\"To come away from group play with three shutouts, as a team defensively, I\'m very proud of that,\" she said. \"It\'s a goal that we have going into every game, especially as a back line, to keep clean sheets. We put a lot of time into team defending as well, all 11 players on the field are defending, and that cohesiveness is what helps bring that.\"\n\nThe team\'s backline in France has shifted due to lineup changes and injuries. Veteran center back Becky Sauerbrunn was held out of the first game because of a minor injury, but came back against Chile when coach Jill Ellis rested players.\n\nAgainst Sweden, Ellis used the backline that is expected to start in the knockout phase, with Abby Dahlkemper alongside Sauerbrunn, Kelley O\'Hara on the right and Crystal Dunn on the left. Dunn was especially effective against Sweden and in thwarting forward Sofia Jakobsson.\n\nThe United States has seven clean sheets in its last eight World Cup matches -- the exception being the two goals allowed in the team\'s 5-2 victory over Japan in the 2015 final. The United States went 540 minutes in Canada without conceding a goal, the longest streak in the tournament since Germany\'s record 679 scoreless minutes from 2003-11.\n\nFormer goalkeeper Hope Solo allowed just three total goals and won her second straight Golden Glove as the tournament\'s top goalkeeper. The backline included Sauerbrunn, Meghan Klingenberg, Julie Johnston and Ali Krieger.\n\nJohnston, now Julie Ertz, has moved up into a role as a defensive midfielder in France. She sat out against Sweden because of a hip contusion but U.S. Soccer characterized the injury as minor. Krieger won a spot on the roster for this tournament because of her big-game experience after a long layoff from the team.\n\nNaeher has replaced Solo, considered one of the game\'s best goalkeepers ever. Solo was dismissed from the team following the 2016 Olympics.\n\nBrushing off the inevitable comparisons, Naeher has been steady in goal.\n\n\"I\'ve played with Alyssa since I was like 16 so I\'ve known her for a really long time. It\'s awesome to see her step into this role because I\'ve always known that she has the capacity and the talent to be the starting goalkeeper on this team. She\'s shown that,\" O\'Hara said. \"She, for me, provides a very calm consistency back there. She\'s also someone with steely nerves. I think she does a really good job of just putting on a game face.\"\n\nThe United States is currently on a streak of 594 minutes since last conceding a goal. The last came in the 81st minute of a 5-3 victory over Australia in April.\n\nEchoing Naeher, Tobin Heath said the Americans have embraced team defense.\n\n\"It\'s huge. It\'s a big part of what we\'re trying to do, both offensively and defensively. We always talk about this idea of 360 defending, where everybody\'s contributing,\" Heath said. \"I think Alyssa\'s been fantastic. It\'s not easy, especially in the first two games to not face that many shots, and then to have a quality opponent like Sweden, to be on her game.\"\n\nIf the top-ranked U.S. can get past No. 13 Spain, there\'s a possibility of a clash against hosts France in the quarterfinal in Paris. The fourth-ranked French, who scored seven goals in the group stage and conceded just one, face Brazil on Sunday.\n\n\"I think this is the best team we\'ve had, and we\'re so confident right now, we\'re so motivated to want to win and succeed,\" Krieger said. \"We know what tools we have and what we need in order to break teams down and be successful in the final third. I think that\'s what we\'ve showcased so far.\"', '1171048266', 'https://sportstalkflorida.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A.-USA-WOMENS-NATIONAL-SOCCER-TEAM.jpeg', 'upload/icon.jpg', 'USA faces Spain in the Knockout round of the Women\'s World Cup noon today. - Sports Talk Florida - N', 'Nigeria News', 'Nigeria Current News', '1171048266.php', 'REIMS, France (AP) -- Much of the attention on the United States rightly goes to its prolific offense, especially after that 13-goal game to open the ....', 0, 'null', 'null'),

That leaves Swedish manager Peter Gerhardsson under a lot of pressure to win here and prove that strategy correct. Sweden had been nearly perfect until then, scoring seven times and giving up just a stoppage-time goal to Thailand in two games. The Swedes\' seven goals have come from six players with only Kosovare Asllani scoring twice. Canada also won advancement after two group games, posting shutout wins over Cameroon and New Zealand before losing by a goal to the Netherlands. Canada made it to the quarterfinals in the tournament it hosted four years ago, the country\'s second-best Women\'s World Cup performance. With a Core Four -- Christine Sinclair, Desiree Scott, Allysha Chapman and Stephanie Labbe -- at least 30 years of age, this team would like to do better than that in France. Only five of the 16 teams to reach the second round scored fewer goals than Canada\'s four in group play. But only four teams have been stingier on defense than Canada, which has given up two goals.
